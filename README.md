基于中文医学知识的LLaMa指令微调模型

在生物医学领域，LLM模型（如LLaMa，ChatGLM）因为缺乏一定的医学专业知识语料而表现不佳。该项目通过医学知识图谱和GPT3.5API构建了中文医学指令数据集，并对LLaMa模型进行了指令微调得到了一个针对医学领域的智能问诊模型HuaTuo，相比于未经过医学数据指令微调的原LLaMa而言，HuaTuo模型在智能问诊层面表现出色，可生成一些更为可靠的医学知识回答；与此同时，基于相同医学数据，该项目还训练了医疗版本的ChatGLM模型: ChatGLM-6B-Med，

该团队还即将发布扁鹊模型PienChueh(同为基于医学数据训练的大模型)，欢迎大家届时使用体验。

### 百川 Baichuan-7B
- https://github.com/baichuan-inc/baichuan-7B
- https://huggingface.co/baichuan-inc/baichuan-7B

baichuan-7B 是由百川智能开发的一个开源可商用的大规模预训练语言模型。基于 Transformer 结构，在大约1.2万亿 tokens 上训练的70亿参数模型，支持中英双语，上下文窗口长度为4096。在标准的中文和英文权威 benchmark（C-EVAL/MMLU）上均取得同尺寸最好的效果。

原始数据包括开源的中英文数据和自行抓取的中文互联网数据，以及部分高质量知识性数据。

参考相关数据工作，频率和质量是数据处理环节重点考虑的两个维度。 我们基于启发式规则和质量模型打分，对原始数据集进行篇章和句子粒度的过滤。在全量数据上，利用局部敏感哈希方法，对篇章和句子粒度做滤重。

基于主动健康的主动性、预防性、精确性、个性化、共建共享、自律性六大特征，华南理工大学未来技术学院-广东省数字孪生人重点实验室开源了中文领域生活空间主动健康大模型基座ProactiveHealthGPT，包括：
- 经过千万规模中文健康对话数据指令微调的生活空间健康大模型扁鹊（BianQue）
- 经过百万规模心理咨询领域中文长文本指令与多轮共情对话数据联合指令微调的心理健康大模型灵心（SoulChat）

我们期望，生活空间主动健康大模型基座ProactiveHealthGPT 可以帮助学术界加速大模型在慢性病、心理咨询等主动健康领域的研究与应用。本项目为 生活空间健康大模型扁鹊（BianQue） 。

### 灵心（SoulChat）
- https://github.com/scutcyr/SoulChat

我们调研了当前常见的心理咨询平台，发现，用户寻求在线心理帮助时，通常需要进行较长篇幅地进行自我描述，然后提供帮助的心理咨询师同样地提供长篇幅的回复，缺失了一个渐进式的倾诉过程。但是，在实际的心理咨询过程当中，用户和心理咨询师之间会存在多轮次的沟通过程，在该过程当中，心理咨询师会引导用户进行倾诉，并且提供共情，例如：“非常棒”、“我理解你的感受”、“当然可以”等等。

考虑到当前十分欠缺多轮共情对话数据集，我们一方面，构建了超过15万规模的 单轮长文本心理咨询指令与答案（SoulChatCorpus-single_turn） ，回答数量超过50万（指令数是当前的常见的心理咨询数据集 PsyQA 的6.7倍），并利用ChatGPT与GPT4，生成总共约100万轮次的 多轮回答数据（SoulChatCorpus-multi_turn） 。特别地，我们在预实验中发现，纯单轮长本文驱动的心理咨询模型会产生让用户感到厌烦的文本长度，而且不具备引导用户倾诉的能力，纯多轮心理咨询对话数据驱动的心理咨询模型则弱化了模型的建议能力，因此，我们混合SoulChatCorpus-single_turn和SoulChatCorpus-multi_turn构造成超过120万个样本的 单轮与多轮混合的共情对话数据集SoulChatCorpus 。所有数据采用“用户：xxx\n心理咨询师：xxx\n用户：xxx\n心理咨询师：”的形式统一为一种指令格式。

我们选择了 ChatGLM-6B 作为初始化模型，进行了全量参数的指令微调，旨在提升模型的共情能力、引导用户倾诉能力以及提供合理建议的能力。更多训练细节请留意我们后续发布的论文。

### 启真医学大模型
- https://github.com/CMKRG/QiZhenGPT

本项目利用启真医学知识库构建的中文医学指令数据集，并基于此在Chinese-LLaMA-Plus-7B、CaMA-13B、ChatGLM-6B模型上进行指令精调，大幅提高了模型在中文医疗场景下效果，首先针对药品知识问答发布了评测数据集，后续计划优化疾病、手术、检验等方面的问答效果，并针对医患问答、病历自动生成等应用展开拓展。

### 貔貅FinMA & PIXIU: A Large Language Model, Instruction Data and Evaluation Benchmark for Finance
- https://github.com/chancefocus/PIXIU
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05443
- https://huggingface.co/spaces/ChanceFocus/FLARE

The advancement of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques in financial technology (FinTech) has enabled a diverse set of capabilities from predicting stock price movements to advanced financial analytics. However, to effectively understand the complex financial language and concepts, domain-specific LLMs are necessary.

Despite prior efforts, there is a lack of open-source financial LLMs and benchmarks to evaluate them. Additionally, these models are not fine-tuned to follow natural language instructions, limiting their performance in downstream financial tasks.

To address these gaps, we introduce PIXIU, providing:
- Open-source LLMs tailored for finance called FinMA, by fine-tuning LLaMA with the dataset constructed in PIXIU.
- Large-scale, high-quality multi-task and multi-modal financial instruction tuning data FIT.
- Holistic financial evaluation benchmarks FLARE for assessing financial LLMs.

Key Features
- Open resources: PIXIU openly provides the financial LLM, instruction tuning data, and datasets included in the evaluation benchmark to encourage open research and transparency.
- Multi-task: The instruction tuning data in PIXIU cover a diverse set of financial tasks, including four financial NLP tasks and one financial prediction task.
- Multi-modality: PIXIU's instruction tuning data consist of multi-modality financial data, including time series data from the stock movement prediction task. It covers various types of financial texts, including reports, news articles, tweets, and regulatory filings.
- Diversity: Unlike previous benchmarks focusing mainly on financial NLP tasks, PIXIU's evaluation benchmark includes critical financial prediction tasks aligned with real-world scenarios, making it more challenging.

### 桃李：国际中文教育大模型
- https://github.com/blcuicall/taoli

随着ChatGPT引起全社会的关注，及各类大语言模型（Large Language Model）争相亮相，通用领域自然语言处理任务已获得巨大成功，引起了国际中文教育领域的普遍关注。

国际中文教育人士纷纷展开了对大模型的探讨： 大模型是否可以根据学习者的水平，提供合适的语言表达，或根据学习者的问题给出详细的解答，从而在一定程度上辅助甚至充当学习伙伴、语言教师？ 然而，目前通用领域的大模型在垂直领域的效果仍有限。

为解决上述问题，我们全面推出适用于国际中文教育领域的大模型 “桃李”（Taoli）1.0 ，一个在国际中文教育领域数据上进行了额外训练的模型。

### Anima：基于QLoRA的33B中文大语言模型
- https://github.com/lyogavin/Anima

AI Community从来都是非常开放的，AI发展到今天，离不开很多以前的重要开源工作，开放共享的Paper，或者的开源数据和代码。我们相信AI的未来也一定是开放的。希望能为开源社区做一些贡献。

为什么33B模型很重要？QLoRA是个Game Changer？

之前大部分开源可finetune的模型大都是比较小的模型7B或者13B，虽然可以在一些简单的chatbot评测集上，通过finetune训练有不错的表现。但是由于这些模型规模还是有限，LLM核心的reasoning的能力还是相对比较弱。这就是为什么很多这种小规模的模型在实际应用的场景表现像是个玩具。如这个工作中的论述：chatbot评测集比较简单，真正比较考验模型能力的复杂逻辑推理及数学问题上小模型和大模型差距还是很明显的。

因此我们认为QLoRA 的工作很重要，重要到可能是个Game Changer。通过QLoRA的优化方法，第一次让33B规模的模型可以比较民主化的，比较低成本的finetune训练，并且普及使用。我们认为33B模型既可以发挥大规模模型的比较强的reasoning能力，又可以针对私有业务领域数据进行灵活的finetune训练提升对于LLM的控制力。

### BBT-FinCUGE-Applications
- https://github.com/ssymmetry/BBT-FinCUGE-Applications
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09432
- https://bbt.ssymmetry.com/index.html

1.目前最大规模的中文金融领域开源语料库BBT-FinCorpus。预训练语料库的规模与多样性对PLM的性能和泛化能力具有重要作用，所以为了更好的训练PLM，首先需要搜集大规模多样性的语料库。然而，目前中文金融领域缺乏大规模多样性开源语料库，已有的中文金融领域模型多数基于小规模的私有语料库，严重限制了中文金融PLM的能力提升。为此，我们构建了BBT-FinCorpus，一个包含有从四种异质性来源获取的约300GB文本的大规模多样性语料库。针对如何确定语料库的覆盖范围和语料来源集合的问题，我们首先搜集了中文互联网上可获取的所有中文金融NLP任务数据集，并根据其文本来源分布来确定所需要爬取的文本来源集合。在确认好需要爬取的文本来源集合之后，我们使用基于代理的分布式爬虫技术实现大规模爬取网页上的文本。

2.目前最大规模的中文金融领域知识增强型预训练语言模型BBT-FinT5。PLM的架构与参数量对其性能有重要影响。现有的中文金融领域PLM都基于较为原始的BERT模型架构，参数量也相对较小，不能满足日益丰富的领域NLP需求。因此，我们基于T5模型架构构建了一个拥有十亿参数量的目前最大规模的中文金融领域预训练语言模型BBT-FinT5。为了在有限的硬件算力条件下，尽可能高效地利用好硬件算力，我们使用DeepSpeed加速框架对预训练过程进行效率优化。此外，我们还针对T5模型设计了独特的知识增强预训练方法，通过实验证明了该方法的有效性。

3.首个中文金融领域自然语言处理评测基准CFLEB。现有的自然语言处理评估基准多是通用领域的，没有公开可用的中文金融领域评测基准。这导致中文金融领域现有的预训练语言模型在不同的任务集合上进行评测，难以相互比较，阻碍了中文金融领域PLM性能的快速提升。为此，我们首先构建了首个中文金融领域自然语言处理评测基准CFLEB，包含六种不同的任务，涵盖对PLM理解与生成能力的评估。针对评测基准任务的选择及其选择标准问题，我们认为领域评测基准应当着重强调任务的实用性，以更好的反映学术界改进PLM对现实世界的帮助。为此，我们首先邀请金融领域专家对所有可获取的中文金融任务进行了实用性评价，筛选出具有较高实用性评分的任务。之后，我们综合任务数据集的开源情况确定了六个任务数据集作为最终的评测基准。该评测基准的早期版本命名为FinCUGE，包含八个任务，该版本目前已舍弃。

但愿世间不纷争，何惜法典卷生尘

ChatGPT浪潮下，人工智能的不断扩展和发展为LLM的扩散提供了肥沃的土壤，目前医疗、教育、金融领域已逐渐有了各自的模型，但法律领域迟迟没有明显进展。

为了促进LLM在法律甚至其他垂直应用落地的开放研究，本项目开源了中文法律大模型，并针对LLM和知识库的结合问题给出了法律场景下合理的解决方案。

ChatLaw法律大模型目前开源的仅供学术参考的版本底座为姜子牙-13B、Anima-33B，我们使用大量法律新闻、法律论坛、法条、司法解释、法律咨询、法考题、判决文书等原始文本来构造对话数据。

基于姜子牙-13B的模型是第一版模型，得益于姜子牙的优秀中文能力和我们对数据清洗、数据增强过程的严格要求，我们在逻辑简单的法律任务上表现优异，但涉及到复杂逻辑的法律推理任务时往往表现不佳。

随后基于Anima-33B，我们增加了训练数据，做成了ChatLaw-33B，发现逻辑推理能力大幅提升，由此可见，大参数的中文LLM是至关重要的。

### DeepSeekMath
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03300
- https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Math

Mathematical reasoning poses a significant challenge for language models due to its complex and structured nature. In this paper, we introduce DeepSeekMath 7B, which continues pre-training DeepSeek-Coder-Base-v1.5 7B with 120B math-related tokens sourced from Common Crawl, together with natural language and code data. DeepSeekMath 7B has achieved an impressive score of 51.7% on the competition-level MATH benchmark without relying on external toolkits and voting techniques, approaching the performance level of Gemini-Ultra and GPT-4. Self-consistency over 64 samples from DeepSeekMath 7B achieves 60.9% on MATH. The mathematical reasoning capability of DeepSeekMath is attributed to two key factors: First, we harness the significant potential of publicly available web data through a meticulously engineered data selection pipeline. Second, we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a variant of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), that enhances mathematical reasoning abilities while concurrently optimizing the memory usage of PPO.

### Multilingual Medicine
- https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/Apollo/tree/main

Despite the vast repository of global medical knowledge predominantly being in English, local languages are crucial for delivering tailored healthcare services, particularly in areas with limited medical resources. To extend the reach of medical AI advancements to a broader population, we aim to develop medical LLMs across the six most widely spoken languages, encompassing a global population of 6.1 billion. This effort culminates in the creation of the ApolloCorpora multilingual medical dataset and the XMedBench benchmark. In the multilingual medical benchmark, the released Apollo models, at various relatively-small sizes (i.e., 0.5B, 1.8B, 2B, 6B, and 7B), achieve the best performance among models of equivalent size. Especially, Apollo-7B is the state-of-the-art multilingual medical LLMs up to 70B. Additionally, these lite models could be used to improve the multi-lingual medical capabilities of larger models without fine-tuning in a proxy-tuning fashion. We will open-source training corpora, code, model weights and evaluation benchmark.

We propose a Multi-disciplinary Collaboration (MC) framework. The framework works in five stages: (i) expert gathering: gather experts from distinct disciplines according to the clinical question; (ii) analysis proposition: domain experts put forward their own analysis with their expertise; (iii) report summarization: compose a summarized report on the basis of a previous series of analyses; (iv) collaborative consultation: engage the experts in discussions over the summarized report. The report will be revised iteratively until an agreement from all the experts is reached; (v) decision making: derive a final decision from the unanimous report.

### Molecule Optimization
- https://github.com/blazerye/DrugAssist
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10334

Recently, the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) on a wide range of tasks has attracted an increasing number of attempts to apply LLMs in drug discovery. However, molecule optimization, a critical task in the drug discovery pipeline, is currently an area that has seen little involvement from LLMs. Most of existing approaches focus solely on capturing the underlying patterns in chemical structures provided by the data, without taking advantage of expert feedback. These non-interactive approaches overlook the fact that the drug discovery process is actually one that requires the integration of expert experience and iterative refinement. To address this gap, we propose DrugAssist, an interactive molecule optimization model which performs optimization through human-machine dialogue by leveraging LLM's strong interactivity and generalizability. DrugAssist has achieved leading results in both single and multiple property optimization, simultaneously showcasing immense potential in transferability and iterative optimization. In addition, we publicly release a large instruction-based dataset called MolOpt-Instructions for fine-tuning language models on molecule optimization tasks. 

### MolTC
- https://github.com/MangoKiller/MolTC
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03781

Molecular Relational Learning (MRL), aiming to understand interactions between molecular pairs, plays a pivotal role in advancing biochemical research. Recently, the adoption of large language models (LLMs), known for their vast knowledge repositories and advanced logical inference capabilities, has emerged as a promising way for efficient and effective MRL. Despite their potential, these methods predominantly rely on the textual data, thus not fully harnessing the wealth of structural information inherent in molecular graphs. Moreover, the absence of a unified framework exacerbates the issue of information underutilization, as it hinders the sharing of interaction mechanism learned across diverse datasets. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel LLM-based multi-modal framework for Molecular inTeraction prediction following Chain-of-Thought (CoT) theory, termed MolTC, which effectively integrate graphical information of two molecules in pair. For achieving a unified MRL, MolTC innovatively develops a dynamic parameter-sharing strategy for cross-dataset information sharing. Moreover, to train MolTC efficiently, we introduce a Multi-hierarchical CoT concept to refine its training paradigm, and conduct a comprehensive Molecular Interactive Instructions dataset for the development of biochemical LLMs involving MRL. Our experiments, conducted across various datasets involving over 4,000,000 molecular pairs, exhibit the superiority of our method over current GNN and LLM-based baselines.

### Mol-Instructions

Large Language Models (LLMs), with their remarkable task-handling capabilities and innovative outputs, have catalyzed significant advancements across a spectrum of fields. However, their proficiency within specialized domains such as biomolecular studies remains limited. To address this challenge, we introduce Mol-Instructions, a comprehensive instruction dataset designed for the biomolecular domain. Mol-Instructions encompasses three key components: molecule-oriented instructions, protein-oriented instructions, and biomolecular text instructions. Each component aims to improve the understanding and prediction capabilities of LLMs concerning biomolecular features and behaviors. Through extensive instruction tuning experiments on LLMs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Mol-Instructions in enhancing large models' performance in the intricate realm of biomolecular studies, thus fostering progress in the biomolecular research community. Mol-Instructions is publicly available for ongoing research and will undergo regular updates to enhance its applicability.

### AlphaGeometry
- https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06747-5
- https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphageometry

Proving mathematical theorems at the olympiad level represents a notable milestone in human-level automated reasoning, owing to their reputed difficulty among the world’s best talents in pre-university mathematics. Current machine-learning approaches, however, are not applicable to most mathematical domains owing to the high cost of translating human proofs into machine-verifiable format. The problem is even worse for geometry because of its unique translation challenges1,5, resulting in severe scarcity of training data. We propose AlphaGeometry, a theorem prover for Euclidean plane geometry that sidesteps the need for human demonstrations by synthesizing millions of theorems and proofs across different levels of complexity. AlphaGeometry is a neuro-symbolic system that uses a neural language model, trained from scratch on our large-scale synthetic data, to guide a symbolic deduction engine through infinite branching points in challenging problems. On a test set of 30 latest olympiad-level problems, AlphaGeometry solves 25, outperforming the previous best method that only solves ten problems and approaching the performance of an average International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) gold medallist. Notably, AlphaGeometry produces human-readable proofs, solves all geometry problems in the IMO 2000 and 2015 under human expert evaluation and discovers a generalized version of a translated IMO theorem in 2004.

### MoE-Mamba
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04081

State Space Models (SSMs) have become serious contenders in the field of sequential modeling, challenging the dominance of Transformers. At the same time, Mixture of Experts (MoE) has significantly improved Transformer-based LLMs, including recent state-of-the-art open-source models. We propose that to unlock the potential of SSMs for scaling, they should be combined with MoE. We showcase this on Mamba, a recent SSM-based model that achieves remarkable, Transformer-like performance. Our model, MoE-Mamba, outperforms both Mamba and Transformer-MoE. In particular, MoE-Mamba reaches the same performance as Mamba in 2.2x less training steps while preserving the inference performance gains of Mamba against the Transformer.

StarCoderBase is trained on 1 trillion tokens sourced from The Stack, a large collection of permissively licensed GitHub repositories with inspection tools and an opt-out process. We fine-tuned StarCoderBase on 35B Python tokens, resulting in the creation of StarCoder. We perform the most comprehensive evaluation of Code LLMs to date and show that StarCoderBase outperforms every open Code LLM that supports multiple programming languages and matches or outperforms the OpenAI code-cushman-001 model. Furthermore, StarCoder outperforms every model that is fine-tuned on Python, can be prompted to achieve 40\% pass@1 on HumanEval, and still retains its performance on other programming languages. We take several important steps towards a safe open-access model release, including an improved PII redaction pipeline and a novel attribution tracing tool, and make the StarCoder models publicly available under a more commercially viable version of the Open Responsible AI Model license.

### OpenMathInstruct-1
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10176
- https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/openmath-65c5619de2ba059be0775014

Recent work has shown the immense potential of synthetically generated datasets for training large language models (LLMs), especially for acquiring targeted skills. Current large-scale math instruction tuning datasets such as MetaMathQA (Yu et al., 2024) and MAmmoTH (Yue et al., 2024) are constructed using outputs from closed-source LLMs with commercially restrictive licenses. A key reason limiting the use of open-source LLMs in these data generation pipelines has been the wide gap between the mathematical skills of the best closed-source LLMs, such as GPT-4, and the best open-source LLMs. Building on the recent progress in open-source LLMs, our proposed prompting novelty, and some brute-force scaling, we construct OpenMathInstruct-1, a math instruction tuning dataset with 1.8M problem-solution pairs. The dataset is constructed by synthesizing code-interpreter solutions for GSM8K and MATH, two popular math reasoning benchmarks, using the recently released and permissively licensed Mixtral model. Our best model, OpenMath-CodeLlama-70B, trained on a subset of OpenMathInstruct-1, achieves a score of 84.6% on GSM8K and 50.7% on MATH, which is competitive with the best gpt-distilled models.

Aya outperforms mT0 and BLOOMZ on the majority of tasks while covering double the number of languages. We introduce extensive new evaluation suites that broaden the state-of-art for multilingual eval across 99 languages -- including discriminative and generative tasks, human evaluation, and simulated win rates that cover both held-out tasks and in-distribution performance. Furthermore, we conduct detailed investigations on the optimal finetuning mixture composition, data pruning, as well as the toxicity, bias, and safety of our models.

### MobiLlama

- https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16840

"Bigger the better" has been the predominant trend in recent Large Language Models (LLMs) development. However, LLMs do not suit well for scenarios that require on-device processing, energy efficiency, low memory footprint, and response efficiency. These requisites are crucial for privacy, security, and sustainable deployment. This paper explores the "less is more" paradigm by addressing the challenge of designing accurate yet efficient Small Language Models (SLMs) for resource constrained devices. Our primary contribution is the introduction of an accurate and fully transparent open-source 0.5 billion (0.5B) parameter SLM, named MobiLlama, catering to the specific needs of resource-constrained computing with an emphasis on enhanced performance with reduced resource demands. MobiLlama is a SLM design that initiates from a larger model and applies a careful parameter sharing scheme to reduce both the pre-training and the deployment cost.

Imagine a developer who can only change their last line of code, how often would they have to start writing a function from scratch before it is correct? Auto-regressive models for code generation from natural language have a similar limitation: they do not easily allow reconsidering earlier tokens generated. We introduce CodeFusion, a pre-trained diffusion code generation model that addresses this limitation by iteratively denoising a complete program conditioned on the encoded natural language. We evaluate CodeFusion on the task of natural language to code generation for Bash, Python, and Microsoft Excel conditional formatting (CF) rules. Experiments show that CodeFusion (75M parameters) performs on par with state-of-the-art auto-regressive systems (350M-175B parameters) in top-1 accuracy and outperforms them in top-3 and top-5 accuracy due to its better balance in diversity versus quality.

LLM agents are typically prompted to produce actions by generating JSON or text in a pre-defined format, which is usually limited by constrained action space (e.g., the scope of pre-defined tools) and restricted flexibility (e.g., inability to compose multiple tools). This work proposes to use executable Python code to consolidate LLM agents' actions into a unified action space (CodeAct). Integrated with a Python interpreter, CodeAct can execute code actions and dynamically revise prior actions or emit new actions upon new observations through multi-turn interactions. Our extensive analysis of 17 LLMs on API-Bank and a newly curated benchmark shows that CodeAct outperforms widely used alternatives (up to 20% higher success rate). The encouraging performance of CodeAct motivates us to build an open-source LLM agent that interacts with environments by executing interpretable code and collaborates with users using natural language. To this end, we collect an instruction-tuning dataset CodeActInstruct that consists of 7k multi-turn interactions using CodeAct. We show that it can be used with existing data to improve models in agent-oriented tasks without compromising their general capability. CodeActAgent, finetuned from Llama2 and Mistral, is integrated with Python interpreter and uniquely tailored to perform sophisticated tasks (e.g., model training) using existing libraries and autonomously self-debug.

### OceanGPT

- https://huggingface.co/zjunlp/oceangpt-7b

(Warning: The model in this paper might produce hallucinations and reader discretion is recommended) Ocean science, which delves into the oceans that are reservoirs of life and biodiversity, is of great significance given that oceans cover over 70% of our planet's surface. Recently, advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the paradigm in science. Despite the success in other domains, current LLMs often fall short in catering to the needs of domain experts like oceanographers, and the potential of LLMs for ocean science is under-explored. The intrinsic reason may be the immense and intricate nature of ocean data as well as the necessity for higher granularity and richness in knowledge. To alleviate these issues, we introduce OceanGPT, the first-ever LLM in the ocean domain, which is expert in various ocean science tasks. We propose DoInstruct, a novel framework to automatically obtain a large volume of ocean domain instruction data, which generates instructions based on multi-agent collaboration. Additionally, we construct the first oceanography benchmark, OceanBench, to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in the ocean domain. Though comprehensive experiments, OceanGPT not only shows a higher level of knowledge expertise for oceans science tasks but also gains preliminary embodied intelligence capabilities in ocean technology.

### K2&GeoGalactica
- https://github.com/davendw49/k2
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00434
- https://github.com/geobrain-ai/geogalactica

K2: We introduce K2 (7B), an open-source language model trained by firstly further pretraining LLaMA on collected and cleaned geoscience literature, including geoscience open-access papers and Wikipedia pages, and secondly fine-tuning with knowledge-intensive instruction tuning data (GeoSignal). As for preliminary evaluation, we use GeoBench (consisting of NPEE and AP Test on Geology, Geography, and Environmental Science) as the benchmark. K2 outperforms the baselines on objectiv e and subjective tasks compared to several baseline models with similar parameters. In this repository, we will share the following code and data.

GeoGalactica: GeoGalactica is from further pre-training of Galactica -- a top-performing LLM trained with a large number of scientific documents. In this work, we take the initial step to leverage LLM for science, through a rather straightforward approach. We try to specialize an open-sourced LLM into geoscience, by further pre-training the model with a vast amount of texts in geoscience, as well as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) the resulting model with our custom collected instruction tuning dataset. These efforts result in a model GeoGalactica consisting of 30 billion parameters. To our best knowledge, it is the largest language model for the geoscience domain.

### SciGLM
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07950
- https://github.com/THUDM/SciGLM

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting scientific discovery. However, such applications are currently limited by LLMs' deficiencies in understanding intricate scientific concepts, deriving symbolic equations, and solving advanced numerical calculations. To bridge these gaps, we introduce SciGLM, a suite of scientific language models able to conduct college-level scientific reasoning. Central to our approach is a novel self-reflective instruction annotation framework to address the data scarcity challenge in the science domain. This framework leverages existing LLMs to generate step-by-step reasoning for unlabelled scientific questions, followed by a process of self-reflective critic-and-revise. Applying this framework, we curated SciInstruct, a diverse and high-quality dataset encompassing mathematics, physics, chemistry, and formal proofs. We fine-tuned the ChatGLM family of language models with SciInstruct, enhancing their capabilities in scientific and mathematical reasoning. Remarkably, SciGLM consistently improves both the base model (ChatGLM3-6B-Base) and larger-scale models (12B and 32B), without sacrificing the language understanding capabilities of the base model. This makes SciGLM a suitable foundational model to facilitate diverse scientific discovery tasks.

### MindLLM
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15777

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various natural language tasks, marking significant strides towards general artificial intelligence. While general artificial intelligence is leveraged by developing increasingly large-scale models, there could be another branch to develop lightweight custom models that better serve certain domains, taking into account the high cost of training and deploying LLMs and the scarcity of resources. In this paper, we present MindLLM, a novel series of bilingual lightweight large language models, trained from scratch, alleviating such burdens by offering models with 1.3 billion and 3 billion parameters. A thorough account of experiences accrued during large model development is given, covering every step of the process, including data construction, model architecture, evaluation, and applications. Such insights are hopefully valuable for fellow academics and developers. MindLLM consistently matches or surpasses the performance of other open-source larger models on some public benchmarks. We also introduce an innovative instruction tuning framework tailored for smaller models to enhance their capabilities efficiently. Moreover, we explore the application of MindLLM in specific vertical domains such as law and finance, underscoring the agility and adaptability of our lightweight models.

### MachineMindset(MBTI)
- https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/Machine-Mindset

MM (Machine_Mindset) series models are developed through a collaboration between FarReel AI Lab(formerly known as the ChatLaw project) and Peking University's Deep Research Institute. These models are large-scale language models for various MBTI types in both Chinese and English, built on the Baichuan and LLaMA2 platforms. 🤖🌐

Our core asset is a self-constructed extensive MBTI dataset consisting of hundreds of thousands of entries. Our models are crafted through multiple stages of pre-training, fine-tuning, and DPO training. We are committed to continuously updating the models to offer superior performance and will consistently supplement them with experimental test results. 📊📈

In contrast to merely using prompts to alter a model's personality, we have found that this method is highly unstable. It's akin to a controlling parent's dissatisfaction with their introverted child, attempting to force them to become outgoing through simple and coercive commands – a rather ludicrous approach. 🙅‍♂️😄

We have successfully achieved personality alignment for various MBTI types using models such as Baichuan, Qwen, LLaMA, and Mistral. This means we can obtain 16 different versions of MBTI personality models by combining different base models with our dataset and training methods, tailoring each model for specific tasks. 🛠🧩

Due to resource constraints, we are initially releasing 16 Chinese models based on Baichuan-7b-chat and several English models based on LLaMA2-7b. However, rest assured that we can quickly add different versions of models if needed. 🌍📦

The power of large language models (LLMs) has been demonstrated through numerous data and computing resources. However, the application of language models on mobile devices is facing huge challenge on the computation and memory costs, that is, tiny language models with high performance are urgently required. Limited by the highly complex training process, there are many details for optimizing language models that are seldom studied carefully. In this study, based on a tiny language model with 1B parameters, we carefully design a series of empirical study to analyze the effect of each component. Three perspectives are mainly discussed, \ie, neural architecture, parameter initialization, and optimization strategy. Several design formulas are empirically proved especially effective for tiny language models, including tokenizer compression, architecture tweaking, parameter inheritance and multiple-round training. Then we train PanGu-\pi-1B Pro and PanGu-\pi-1.5B Pro on 1.6T multilingual corpora, following the established formulas. Experimental results demonstrate the improved optimization and architecture yield a notable average improvement of 8.87 on benchmark evaluation sets for PanGu-\pi-1B Pro. Besides, PanGu-\pi-1.5B Pro surpasses a range of SOTA models with larger model sizes, validating its superior performance.

Low-Rank LLaMA Instruct-Tuning

This repository contains code for reproducing the Stanford Alpaca results using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We provide an Instruct model of similar quality to text-davinci-003 that can run on a Raspberry Pi (for research), and the code can be easily extended to the 13b, 30b, and 65b models.

In addition to the training code, which runs within five hours on a single RTX 4090, we publish a script for downloading and inference on the foundation model and LoRA, as well as the resulting LoRA weights themselves. To fine-tune cheaply and efficiently, we use Hugging Face's PEFT as well as Tim Dettmers' bitsandbytes.

Without hyperparameter tuning or validation-based checkpointing, the LoRA model produces outputs comparable to the Stanford Alpaca model. (Please see the outputs included below.) Further tuning might be able to achieve better performance; I invite interested users to give it a try and report their results.

主流的大型语言模型训练都离不开RLHF(人工反馈强化学习)，其主要思想是使用人类专家提供的反馈示例来指导模型的学习过程，它可以加速强化学习过程，提高大模型的性能，但「目前RLHF这个过程既复杂又昂贵」。

 针对RLHF这个问题，学术界目前主要有两种解决方法：「1）避开RLHF」，比如Meta最近研究的“Meta最新模型：LIMA-65B，没有RLHF，模型效果远胜Alpaca！！”，验证了精心制作的少量标注数据同样能达到不错的效果。2）「简化RLHF」，就是今天给大家分享的这篇文章：斯坦福发布了一个名为AlpacaFarm（羊驼农场）的模拟器，旨在降低训练语言模型的成本，且比人工成本低45倍，并表现出与人类反馈的高度一致性，同时也为RLHF的研究开辟了新的道路。

DPO的核心原理是：PPO训练难度核心是因为需要通过reward model来表达偏好，进行强化学习。

为了不再依赖于reward model进行强化学习，他进行了一系列的数学变换，直接推导出了基于Policy Language Model的标注偏好的概率表达形式，从而可以直接求解一个Language Model的最大似然估计。不再需要复杂繁琐的reward model和强化学习。

While large-scale unsupervised language models (LMs) learn broad world knowledge and some reasoning skills, achieving precise control of their behavior is difficult due to the completely unsupervised nature of their training. Existing methods for gaining such steerability collect human labels of the relative quality of model generations and fine-tune the unsupervised LM to align with these preferences, often with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, RLHF is a complex and often unstable procedure, first fitting a reward model that reflects the human preferences, and then fine-tuning the large unsupervised LM using reinforcement learning to maximize this estimated reward without drifting too far from the original model. In this paper, we leverage a mapping between reward functions and optimal policies to show that this constrained reward maximization problem can be optimized exactly with a single stage of policy training, essentially solving a classification problem on the human preference data. The resulting algorithm, which we call Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), is stable, performant and computationally lightweight, eliminating the need for fitting a reward model, sampling from the LM during fine-tuning, or performing significant hyperparameter tuning. Our experiments show that DPO can fine-tune LMs to align with human preferences as well as or better than existing methods. Notably, fine-tuning with DPO exceeds RLHF's ability to control sentiment of generations and improves response quality in summarization and single-turn dialogue while being substantially simpler to implement and train.

FlexGen is a high-throughput generation engine for running large language models with limited GPU memory. FlexGen allows high-throughput generation by IO-efficient offloading, compression, and large effective batch sizes.

Limitation. As an offloading-based system running on weak GPUs, FlexGen also has its limitations. FlexGen can be significantly slower than the case when you have enough powerful GPUs to hold the whole model, especially for small-batch cases. FlexGen is mostly optimized for throughput-oriented batch processing settings (e.g., classifying or extracting information from many documents in batches), on single GPUs.

We present QLoRA, an efficient finetuning approach that reduces memory usage enough to finetune a 65B parameter model on a single 48GB GPU while preserving full 16-bit finetuning task performance. QLoRA backpropagates gradients through a frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank Adapters (LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all previous openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the performance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a single GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without sacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is information theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) Double Quantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the quantization constants, and (c) Paged Optimizers to manage memory spikes. We use QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of instruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets, multiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to run with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results show that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to state-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous SoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human and GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable alternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot benchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of chatbots. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for 4-bit training.

### LOw-Memory Optimization (LOMO)
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09782
- https://github.com/OpenLMLab/LOMO

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) but demand massive GPU resources for training. Lowering the threshold for LLMs training would encourage greater participation from researchers, benefiting both academia and society. While existing approaches have focused on parameter-efficient fine-tuning, which tunes or adds a small number of parameters, few have addressed the challenge of tuning the full parameters of LLMs with limited resources. In this work, we propose a new optimizer, LOw-Memory Optimization (LOMO), which fuses the gradient computation and the parameter update in one step to reduce memory usage. By integrating LOMO with existing memory saving techniques, we reduce memory usage to 10.8% compared to the standard approach (DeepSpeed solution). Consequently, our approach enables the full parameter fine-tuning of a 65B model on a single machine with 8 RTX 3090, each with 24GB memory.

### llama2.c
- https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c
- https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/RFo6B5yfEhv4mihkBiOH4Q

With the code in this repo you can train the Llama 2 LLM architecture from scratch in PyTorch, then export the weights to a binary file, and load that into one ~simple 500-line C file (run.c) that inferences the model. Alternatively, you can load, finetune, and inference Meta's Llama 2 (but this is still being actively fleshed out). Hence, this repo is a "fullstack" train + inference solution for Llama 2 LLM, with a focus on minimalism and simplicity. You might think that you need many billion parameter LLMs to do anything useful, but in fact very small LLMs can have surprisingly strong performance if you make the domain narrow enough. I recommend looking at the TinyStories paper for inspiration.

Please note that this started recently as just a fun weekend project: I took my earlier nanoGPT, tuned it to implement the Llama-2 architecture instead of GPT-2, and the meat of it was writing the C inference engine in run.c. So the project is young and moving quickly. Hat tip to the awesome llama.cpp for inspiring this project. I wanted something super minimal so I chose to hard-code the Llama 2 architecture, stick to fp32, and just roll one inference file of pure C with no dependencies.

### LongLoRA
- https://github.com/dvlab-research/longlora
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12307v1.pdf

We present LongLoRA, an efficient fine-tuning approach that extends the context sizes of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), with limited computation cost. Typically, training LLMs with long context sizes is computationally expensive, requiring extensive training hours and GPU resources. In this paper, we speed up the context extension of LLMs in two aspects. On the one hand, although dense global attention is needed during inference, fine-tuning the model can be effectively and efficiently done by sparse local attention. The proposed shift short attention effectively enables context extension, leading to non-trivial computation saving with similar performance to fine-tuning with vanilla attention. On the other hand, we find that LoRA for context extension works well under the premise of trainable embedding and normalization. LongLoRA demonstrates strong empirical results on various tasks on LLaMA2 models from 7B/13B to 70B. LongLoRA adopts LLaMA2 7B from 4k context to 100k, or LLaMA2 70B to 32k on a single 8x A100 machine. LongLoRA extends models' context while retaining their original architectures, and is compatible with most existing techniques, like FlashAttention-2. In addition, to make LongLoRA practical, we collect a dataset, LongQA, for supervised fine-tuning. It contains more than 3k long context question-answer pairs.

### S-LoRA
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.03285.pdf
- https://github.com/S-LoRA/S-LoRA

The "pretrain-then-finetune" paradigm is commonly adopted in the deployment of large language models. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, is often employed to adapt a base model to a multitude of tasks, resulting in a substantial collection of LoRA adapters derived from one base model. We observe that this paradigm presents significant opportunities for batched inference during serving. To capitalize on these opportunities, we present S-LoRA, a system designed for the scalable serving of many LoRA adapters. S-LoRA stores all adapters in the main memory and fetches the adapters used by the currently running queries to the GPU memory. To efficiently use the GPU memory and reduce fragmentation, S-LoRA proposes Unified Paging. Unified Paging uses a unified memory pool to manage dynamic adapter weights with different ranks and KV cache tensors with varying sequence lengths. Additionally, S-LoRA employs a novel tensor parallelism strategy and highly optimized custom CUDA kernels for heterogeneous batching of LoRA computation. Collectively, these features enable S-LoRA to serve thousands of LoRA adapters on a single GPU or across multiple GPUs with a small overhead. Compared to state-of-the-art libraries such as HuggingFace PEFT and vLLM (with naive support of LoRA serving), S-LoRA can improve the throughput by up to 4 times and increase the number of served adapters by several orders of magnitude. As a result, S-LoRA enables scalable serving of many task-specific fine-tuned models and offers the potential for large-scale customized fine-tuning services.

### SoRA
- https://github.com/TsinghuaC3I/SoRA
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11696

Sparse Low-rank Adaptation of Pre-trained Language Models

Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models in a parameter-efficient manner is widely studied for its effectiveness and efficiency. The popular method of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) offers a notable approach, hypothesizing that the adaptation process is intrinsically low-dimensional. Although LoRA has demonstrated commendable performance, it is implemented with a fixed and unalterable intrinsic rank that might not always be the ideal choice. Recognizing the need for more flexible adaptation, we extend the methodology of LoRA to an innovative approach we call sparse low-rank adaptation (SoRA) that enables dynamic adjustments to the intrinsic rank during the adaptation process. We achieve this through the incorporation of a gate unit optimized with proximal gradient method in the training stage, controlling the cardinality of rank under the sparsity of the gate. In the subsequent inference stage, we eliminate the parameter blocks corresponding to the zeroed-out ranks, to reduce each SoRA module back to a concise yet rank-optimal LoRA. Our approach strengthens the representation power of LoRA by initializing it with a higher rank, while efficiently taming a temporarily increased number of parameters via updating in a sparse way. We further introduce a sparsifying scheduler for SoRA, aiming to examine the impact of the number of non-zero parameters on the model's memorization and generalization. Our experimental results demonstrate that SoRA can outperform other baselines even with 70% retained parameters and 70% training time.

### DeepSpeed-FastGen
- https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/blob/master/blogs/deepspeed-fastgen/README.md

Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and LLaMA have emerged as a dominant workload in serving a wide range of applications infused with AI at every level. From general chat models to document summarization, and from autonomous driving to copilots at every layer of the software stack, the demand to deploy and serve these models at scale has skyrocketed. While frameworks like DeepSpeed, PyTorch, and several others can regularly achieve good hardware utilization during LLM training, the interactive nature of these applications and the poor arithmetic intensity of tasks like open-ended text generation have become the bottleneck for inference throughput in existing systems.

To this end, frameworks like vLLM powered by PagedAttention and research systems like Orca have significantly improved the performance of inference for LLMs. However, these systems still struggle to provide consistent quality of service, particularly for workloads with longer prompts. These long prompt workloads are becoming increasingly important as more and more models, like MPT-StoryWriter, and systems, such as DeepSpeed Ulysses, support context windows stretching to tens of thousands of tokens. To better understand the problem space, we provide detailed examples of how text generation works for LLMs in two distinct phases called prompt processing and generation. When systems treat them as distinct phases, generation will be preempted by prompt processing that risks breaking the service level agreements (SLAs).

Today, we are glad to present DeepSpeed-FastGen, a system that overcomes these limitations by leveraging the proposed Dynamic SplitFuse technique and offers up to 2.3x higher effective throughput compared to state-of-the-art systems like vLLM. DeepSpeed-FastGen leverages the combination of DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference to provide an easy-to-use serving system.

### RLAIF: Scaling Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback with AI Feedback
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00267

Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effective in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, gathering high-quality human preference labels can be a time-consuming and expensive endeavor. RL from AI Feedback (RLAIF), introduced by Bai et al., offers a promising alternative that leverages a powerful off-the-shelf LLM to generate preferences in lieu of human annotators. Across the tasks of summarization, helpful dialogue generation, and harmless dialogue generation, RLAIF achieves comparable or superior performance to RLHF, as rated by human evaluators. Furthermore, RLAIF demonstrates the ability to outperform a supervised fine-tuned baseline even when the LLM preference labeler is the same size as the policy. In another experiment, directly prompting the LLM for reward scores achieves superior performance to the canonical RLAIF setup, where LLM preference labels are first distilled into a reward model. Finally, we conduct extensive studies on techniques for generating aligned AI preferences. Our results suggest that RLAIF can achieve human-level performance, offering a potential solution to the scalability limitations of RLHF.

- https://openai.com/research/weak-to-strong-generalization

A core challenge for aligning future superhuman AI systems (superalignment) is that humans will need to supervise AI systems much smarter than them. We study a simple analogy: can small models supervise large models? We show that we can use a GPT-2-level model to elicit most of GPT-4’s capabilities—close to GPT-3.5-level performance—generalizing correctly even to hard problems where the small model failed. This opens up a new research direction that allows us to directly tackle a central challenge of aligning future superhuman models while making iterative empirical progress today.

Large language models (LLMs) have been applied in various applications due to their astonishing capabilities. With advancements in technologies such as chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and in-context learning (ICL), the prompts fed to LLMs are becoming increasingly lengthy, even exceeding tens of thousands of tokens. To accelerate model inference and reduce cost, this paper presents LLMLingua, a coarse-to-fine prompt compression method that involves a budget controller to maintain semantic integrity under high compression ratios, a token-level iterative compression algorithm to better model the interdependence between compressed contents, and an instruction tuning based method for distribution alignment between language models. We conduct experiments and analysis over four datasets from different scenarios, i.e., GSM8K, BBH, ShareGPT, and Arxiv-March23; showing that the proposed approach yields state-of-the-art performance and allows for up to 20x compression with little performance loss. 

### Large Language Model Unlearning
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10683
- https://github.com/kevinyaobytedance/llm_unlearn

We study how to perform unlearning, i.e. forgetting undesirable (mis)behaviors, on large language models (LLMs). We show at least three scenarios of aligning LLMs with human preferences can benefit from unlearning: (1) removing harmful responses, (2) erasing copyright-protected content as requested, and (3) eliminating hallucinations. Unlearning, as an alignment technique, has three advantages. (1) It only requires negative (e.g. harmful) examples, which are much easier and cheaper to collect (e.g. via red teaming or user reporting) than positive (e.g. helpful and often human-written) examples required in RLHF (RL from human feedback). (2) It is computationally efficient. (3) It is especially effective when we know which training samples cause the misbehavior. To the best of our knowledge, our work is among the first to explore LLM unlearning. We are also among the first to formulate the settings, goals, and evaluations in LLM unlearning. We show that if practitioners only have limited resources, and therefore the priority is to stop generating undesirable outputs rather than to try to generate desirable outputs, unlearning is particularly appealing. Despite only having negative samples, our ablation study shows that unlearning can still achieve better alignment performance than RLHF with just 2% of its computational time.

### PowerInfer
- https://github.com/SJTU-IPADS/PowerInfer
- https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/_media/publications/powerinfer-20231219.pdf

PowerInfer is a CPU/GPU LLM inference engine leveraging activation locality for your device.

We introduce PowerInfer, a high-speed Large Language Model (LLM) inference engine on a personal computer (PC) equipped with a single consumer-grade GPU. The key underlying the design of PowerInfer is exploiting the high locality inherent in LLM inference, characterized by a power-law distribution in neuron activation.

This distribution indicates that a small subset of neurons, termed hot neurons, are consistently activated across inputs, while the majority, cold neurons, vary based on specific inputs. PowerInfer exploits such an insight to design a GPU-CPU hybrid inference engine: hot-activated neurons are preloaded onto the GPU for fast access, while cold-activated neurons are computed on the CPU, thus significantly reducing GPU memory demands and CPU-GPU data transfers. PowerInfer further integrates adaptive predictors and neuron-aware sparse operators, optimizing the efficiency of neuron activation and computational sparsity.

Evaluation shows that PowerInfer attains an average token generation rate of 13.20 tokens/s, with a peak of 29.08 tokens/s, across various LLMs (including OPT-175B) on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, only 18% lower than that achieved by a top-tier server-grade A100 GPU. This significantly outperforms llama.cpp by up to 11.69x while retaining model accuracy.

LASER stands for LAyer SElective Rank-Reduction, and is an intervention where we replace a selected weight matrix in the transformer architecture of an LLM with its low-rank approximation. A single LASER transformation consists of 3 hyperparameters: the layer number to modify (ℓ) such as 16th layer, the parameter type (τ) such as the first MLP layer, and the fraction of the maximum rank to retain (ρ) such as 0.01 fraction of the rank. We can write this transformation as (ℓ, τ, ρ) and we can stack these transformations and apply them in parallel. The low-rank approximation is performed using SVD. Figure below from our paper shows an illustration.

### SPIN（Self-Play Fine-Tuning Converts Weak Language Models to Strong Language Models）
- hhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01335

Harnessing the power of human-annotated data through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is pivotal for advancing Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we delve into the prospect of growing a strong LLM out of a weak one without the need for acquiring additional human-annotated data. We propose a new fine-tuning method called Self-Play fIne-tuNing (SPIN), which starts from a supervised fine-tuned model. At the heart of SPIN lies a self-play mechanism, where the LLM refines its capability by playing against instances of itself. More specifically, the LLM generates its own training data from its previous iterations, refining its policy by discerning these self-generated responses from those obtained from human-annotated data. Our method progressively elevates the LLM from a nascent model to a formidable one, unlocking the full potential of human-annotated demonstration data for SFT. Theoretically, we prove that the global optimum to the training objective function of our method is achieved only when the LLM policy aligns with the target data distribution. Empirically, we evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets including the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard, MT-Bench, and datasets from Big-Bench. Our results show that SPIN can significantly improve the LLM's performance across a variety of benchmarks and even outperform models trained through direct preference optimization (DPO) supplemented with extra GPT-4 preference data. This sheds light on the promise of self-play, enabling the achievement of human-level performance in LLMs without the need for expert opponents.

### Self-Rewarding Language Models
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10020.pdf

We posit that to achieve superhuman agents, future models require superhuman feedback in order to provide an adequate training signal. Current approaches commonly train reward models from human preferences, which may then be bottlenecked by human performance level, and secondly these separate frozen reward models cannot then learn to improve during LLM training. In this work, we study Self-Rewarding Language Models, where the language model itself is used via LLM-as-a-Judge prompting to provide its own rewards during training. We show that during Iterative DPO training that not only does instruction following ability improve, but also the ability to provide high-quality rewards to itself. Fine-tuning Llama 2 70B on three iterations of our approach yields a model that outperforms many existing systems on the AlpacaEval 2.0 leaderboard, including Claude 2, Gemini Pro, and GPT-4 0613. While only a preliminary study, this work opens the door to the possibility of models that can continually improve in both axes.

### OPO（On-the-fly Preference Optimization）
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15907
- https://gair-nlp.github.io/OPO/
- https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/OPO

In this paper, we aim to align large language models with the ever-changing, complex, and diverse human values (e.g., social norms) across time and locations. This presents a challenge to existing alignment techniques, such as supervised fine-tuning, which internalize values within model parameters. To overcome this, we propose an On-the-fly Preference Optimization (OPO) method, which is a real-time alignment that works in a streaming way. It employs an external memory to store established rules for alignment, which can constrain LLMs' behaviors without further training, allowing for convenient updates and customization of human values. We also introduce a scalable evaluation to assess the proposed method more effectively. Experimental results on both human-annotated and auto-generated questions from legal and moral domains indicate the effectiveness of the proposed OPO method. 

### ASPIRE

Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown great advances in a variety of tasks, including natural language understanding and generation. However, their use in high-stakes decision-making scenarios is still limited due to the potential for errors. Selective prediction is a technique that can be used to improve the reliability of the LLMs by allowing them to abstain from making predictions when they are unsure of the answer. In this work, we propose a novel framework for adaptation with self-evaluation to improve the selective prediction performance of LLMs. Our framework is based on the idea of using parameter-efficient tuning to adapt the LLM to the specific task at hand while improving its ability to perform self-evaluation. We evaluate our method on a variety of question-answering (QA) datasets and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art selective prediction methods. For example, on the CoQA benchmark, our method improves the AUACC from 91.23% to 92.63% and improves the AUROC from 74.61% to 80.25%.

### The Impact of Reasoning Step Length on Large Language Models
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04925
- https://github.com/jmyissb/The-Impact-of-Reasoning-Step-Length-on-Large-Language-Models

Chain of Thought (CoT) is significant in improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the correlation between the effectiveness of CoT and the length of reasoning steps in prompts remains largely unknown. To shed light on this, we have conducted several empirical experiments to explore the relations. Specifically, we design experiments that expand and compress the rationale reasoning steps within CoT demonstrations, while keeping all other factors constant. We have the following key findings. First, the results indicate that lengthening the reasoning steps in prompts, even without adding new information into the prompt, considerably enhances LLMs' reasoning abilities across multiple datasets. Alternatively, shortening the reasoning steps, even while preserving the key information, significantly diminishes the reasoning abilities of models. This finding highlights the importance of the number of steps in CoT prompts and provides practical guidance to make better use of LLMs' potential in complex problem-solving scenarios. Second, we also investigated the relationship between the performance of CoT and the rationales used in demonstrations. Surprisingly, the result shows that even incorrect rationales can yield favorable outcomes if they maintain the requisite length of inference. Third, we observed that the advantages of increasing reasoning steps are task-dependent: simpler tasks require fewer steps, whereas complex tasks gain significantly from longer inference sequences.

### SliceGPT
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15024
- https://github.com/microsoft/TransformerCompression

SliceGPT is a new post-training sparsification scheme that makes transformer networks (including LLMs) smaller by first applying orthogonal transformations to each transformer layer that leave the model unchanged, and then slicing off the least-significant rows and columns (chosen by the eigenvalue decay) of the weight matrices. The model structure is left unchanged, but each weight matrix is replaced by a smaller (dense) weight matrix, reducing the embedding dimension of the model. This results in speedups (without any additional code optimization) and a reduced memory footprint.

### FuseLLM
- https://github.com/fanqiwan/FuseLLM
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10491

While training large language models (LLMs) from scratch can generate models with distinct functionalities and strengths, it comes at significant costs and may result in redundant capabilities. Alternatively, a cost-effective and compelling approach is to merge existing pre-trained LLMs into a more potent model. However, due to the varying architectures of these LLMs, directly blending their weights is impractical. In this paper, we introduce the notion of knowledge fusion for LLMs, aimed at combining the capabilities of existing LLMs and transferring them into a single LLM. By leveraging the generative distributions of source LLMs, we externalize their collective knowledge and unique strengths, thereby potentially elevating the capabilities of the target model beyond those of any individual source LLM. We validate our approach using three popular LLMs with different architectures--Llama-2, MPT, and OpenLLaMA--across various benchmarks and tasks. Our findings confirm that the fusion of LLMs can improve the performance of the target model across a range of capabilities such as reasoning, commonsense, and code generation.

### Tree of Thoughts
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601
- https://github.com/princeton-nlp/tree-of-thought-llm

Language models are increasingly being deployed for general problem solving across a wide range of tasks, but are still confined to token-level, left-to-right decision-making processes during inference. This means they can fall short in tasks that require exploration, strategic lookahead, or where initial decisions play a pivotal role. To surmount these challenges, we introduce a new framework for language model inference, Tree of Thoughts (ToT), which generalizes over the popular Chain of Thought approach to prompting language models, and enables exploration over coherent units of text (thoughts) that serve as intermediate steps toward problem solving. ToT allows LMs to perform deliberate decision making by considering multiple different reasoning paths and self-evaluating choices to decide the next course of action, as well as looking ahead or backtracking when necessary to make global choices. Our experiments show that ToT significantly enhances language models' problem-solving abilities on three novel tasks requiring non-trivial planning or search: Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Mini Crosswords. For instance, in Game of 24, while GPT-4 with chain-of-thought prompting only solved 4% of tasks, our method achieved a success rate of 74%.

### CogGPT
- https://github.com/KwaiKEG/CogGPT
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08438

Cognitive dynamics are pivotal to advance human understanding of the world. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) reveal their potential for cognitive simulation. However, these LLM-based cognitive studies primarily focus on static modeling, overlooking the dynamic nature of cognition. To bridge this gap, we propose the concept of the cognitive dynamics of LLMs and present a corresponding task with the inspiration of longitudinal studies. Towards the task, we develop CogBench, a novel benchmark to assess the cognitive dynamics of LLMs and validate it through participant surveys. We also design two evaluation metrics for CogBench, including Authenticity and Rationality. Recognizing the inherent static nature of LLMs, we introduce CogGPT for the task, which features an innovative iterative cognitive mechanism aimed at enhancing lifelong cognitive dynamics. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of CogGPT over existing methods, particularly in its ability to facilitate role-specific cognitive dynamics under continuous information flows.

This repo draws from the excellently written DPO repo and has preserved many design choices from the original. Some of the key changes we introduced are:

- making data loading more modular, so that you can easily write your own dataloader
- making trainers more modular, so that each HALO has its own trainer subclass
- adding code for doing open-ended evaluation with GPT-4 as a judge
- supporting losses beyond SFT and DPO (including KTO, PPO (offline, off-policy variant), and SLiC)

### Aligner
- https://aligner2024.github.io
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02416

Efforts to align Large Language Models (LLMs) are mainly conducted via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methods. However, RLHF encounters major challenges including training reward models, actor-critic engineering, and importantly, it requires access to LLM parameters. Here we introduce Aligner, a new efficient alignment paradigm that bypasses the whole RLHF process by learning the correctional residuals between the aligned and the unaligned answers. Our Aligner offers several key advantages. Firstly, it is an autoregressive seq2seq model that is trained on the query-answer-correction dataset via supervised learning; this offers a parameter-efficient alignment solution with minimal resources. Secondly, the Aligner facilitates weak-to-strong generalization; finetuning large pretrained models by Aligner's supervisory signals demonstrates strong performance boost. Thirdly, Aligner functions as a model-agnostic plug-and-play module, allowing for its direct application on different open-source and API-based models. Remarkably, Aligner-7B improves 11 different LLMs by 21.9% in helpfulness and 23.8% in harmlessness on average (GPT-4 by 17.5% and 26.9%). When finetuning (strong) Llama2-70B with (weak) Aligner-13B's supervision, we can improve Llama2 by 8.2% in helpfulness and 61.6% in harmlessness. 

### RPO（Robust Prompt Optimization）
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17263

Despite advances in AI alignment, language models (LM) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks or jailbreaking, in which adversaries modify input prompts to induce harmful behavior. While some defenses have been proposed, they focus on narrow threat models and fall short of a strong defense, which we posit should be effective, universal, and practical. To achieve this, we propose the first adversarial objective for defending LMs against jailbreaking attacks and an algorithm, robust prompt optimization (RPO), that uses gradient-based token optimization to enforce harmless outputs. This results in an easily accessible suffix that significantly improves robustness to both jailbreaks seen during optimization and unknown, held-out jailbreaks, reducing the attack success rate on Starling-7B from 84% to 8.66% across 20 jailbreaks. In addition, we find that RPO has a minor effect on benign use, is successful under adaptive attacks, and can transfer to black-box models, reducing the success rate of the strongest attack on GPT-4, GUARD, from 92% to 6%.

### Inference-Time Training Helps Long Text Generation
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11504
- https://github.com/TemporaryLoRA/Temp-LoRA/tree/main

Long text generation, such as novel writing or discourse-level translation with extremely long contexts, presents significant challenges to current language models. Existing methods mainly focus on extending the model's context window through strategies like length extrapolation. However, these approaches demand substantial hardware resources during the training and/or inference phases. Our proposed method, Temp-Lora, introduces an alternative concept. Instead of relying on the KV cache to store all context information, Temp-Lora embeds this information directly into the model's parameters. In the process of long text generation, we use a temporary Lora module, progressively trained with text generated previously. This approach not only efficiently preserves contextual knowledge but also prevents any permanent alteration to the model's parameters given that the module is discarded post-generation. Extensive experiments on the PG19 language modeling benchmark and the GuoFeng discourse-level translation benchmark validate the effectiveness of Temp-Lora. Our results show that: 1) Temp-Lora substantially enhances generation quality for long texts, as indicated by a 13.2% decrease in perplexity on a subset of PG19, and a 29.6% decrease in perplexity along with a 53.2% increase in BLEU score on GuoFeng, 2) Temp-Lora is compatible with and enhances most existing long text generation methods, and 3) Temp-Lora can greatly reduce computational costs by shortening the context window. While ensuring a slight improvement in generation quality (a decrease of 3.8% in PPL), it enables a reduction of 70.5% in the FLOPs required for inference and a 51.5% decrease in latency.

### LiPO
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01878

Aligning language models (LMs) with curated human feedback is critical to control their behaviors in real-world applications. Several recent policy optimization methods, such as DPO and SLiC, serve as promising alternatives to the traditional Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) approach. In practice, human feedback often comes in a format of a ranked list over multiple responses to amortize the cost of reading prompt. Multiple responses can also be ranked by reward models or AI feedback. There lacks such a study on directly fitting upon a list of responses. In this work, we formulate the LM alignment as a listwise ranking problem and describe the Listwise Preference Optimization (LiPO) framework, where the policy can potentially learn more effectively from a ranked list of plausible responses given the prompt. This view draws an explicit connection to Learning-to-Rank (LTR), where most existing preference optimization work can be mapped to existing ranking objectives, especially pairwise ones. Following this connection, we provide an examination of ranking objectives that are not well studied for LM alignment withDPO and SLiC as special cases when list size is two. In particular, we highlight a specific method, LiPO-{\lambda}, which leverages a state-of-the-art listwise ranking objective and weights each preference pair in a more advanced manner. We show that LiPO-{\lambda} can outperform DPO and SLiC by a clear margin on two preference alignment tasks.

### Self-Discover
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03620

We introduce SELF-DISCOVER, a general framework for LLMs to self-discover the task-intrinsic reasoning structures to tackle complex reasoning problems that are challenging for typical prompting methods. Core to the framework is a self-discovery process where LLMs select multiple atomic reasoning modules such as critical thinking and step-by-step thinking, and compose them into an explicit reasoning structure for LLMs to follow during decoding. SELF-DISCOVER substantially improves GPT-4 and PaLM 2's performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks such as BigBench-Hard, grounded agent reasoning, and MATH, by as much as 32% compared to Chain of Thought (CoT). Furthermore, SELF-DISCOVER outperforms inference-intensive methods such as CoT-Self-Consistency by more than 20%, while requiring 10-40x fewer inference compute. Finally, we show that the self-discovered reasoning structures are universally applicable across model families: from PaLM 2-L to GPT-4, and from GPT-4 to Llama2, and share commonalities with human reasoning patterns.

### DoRA
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09353
- https://github.com/catid/dora

Among the widely used parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) methods, LoRA and its variants have gained considerable popularity because of avoiding additional inference costs. However, there still often exists an accuracy gap between these methods and full fine-tuning (FT). In this work, we first introduce a novel weight decomposition analysis to investigate the inherent differences between FT and LoRA. Aiming to resemble the learning capacity of FT from the findings, we propose Weight-Decomposed LowRank Adaptation (DoRA). DoRA decomposes the pre-trained weight into two components, magnitude and direction, for fine-tuning, specifically employing LoRA for directional updates to efficiently minimize the number of trainable parameters. By employing DoRA, we enhance both the learning capacity and training stability of LoRA while avoiding any additional inference overhead. DoRA consistently outperforms LoRA on fine-tuning LLaMA, LLaVA, and VL-BART on various downstream tasks, such as commonsense reasoning, visual instruction tuning, and image/video-text understanding.

### GPO（Generalized Preference Optimization）
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05749

Offline preference optimization allows fine-tuning large models directly from offline data, and has proved effective in recent alignment practices. We propose generalized preference optimization (GPO), a family of offline losses parameterized by a general class of convex functions. GPO enables a unified view over preference optimization, encompassing existing algorithms such as DPO, IPO and SLiC as special cases, while naturally introducing new variants. The GPO framework also sheds light on how offline algorithms enforce regularization, through the design of the convex function that defines the loss. Our analysis and experiments reveal the connections and subtle differences between the offline regularization and the KL divergence regularization intended by the canonical RLHF formulation. In all, our results present new algorithmic toolkits and empirical insights to alignment practitioners.

### CoT-decoding
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10200

In enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), prior research primarily focuses on specific prompting techniques such as few-shot or zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. These methods, while effective, often involve manually intensive prompt engineering. Our study takes a novel approach by asking: Can LLMs reason effectively without prompting? Our findings reveal that, intriguingly, CoT reasoning paths can be elicited from pre-trained LLMs by simply altering the \textit{decoding} process. Rather than conventional greedy decoding, we investigate the top-k alternative tokens, uncovering that CoT paths are frequently inherent in these sequences. This approach not only bypasses the confounders of prompting but also allows us to assess the LLMs' \textit{intrinsic} reasoning abilities. Moreover, we observe that the presence of a CoT in the decoding path correlates with a higher confidence in the model's decoded answer. This confidence metric effectively differentiates between CoT and non-CoT paths. Extensive empirical studies on various reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed CoT-decoding substantially outperforms the standard greedy decoding.

With the release of Mojo, I was inspired to take my Python port of llama2.py and transition it to Mojo. The result? A version that leverages Mojo's SIMD & vectorization primitives, boosting the Python performance by nearly 250x. Impressively, the Mojo version now outperforms the original llama2.c, even in runfast mode, by 15-20%. This showcases the potential of hardware-level optimizations through Mojo's advanced features. I think this also can help us to see how far can we go with the original llama2.c hardware optimizations.

### Megatron-LLaMA

- https://github.com/alibaba/Megatron-LLaMA

To facilitate the training of LLaMA-based models and reduce the cost on occupying hardware resources, Alibaba decides to release the internal optimized Megatron-LLaMA training framework to the community. Megatron-LLaMA makes the following contributions:

(i) A standard implementation of LLaMA in Megatron-LLaMA: It is easy to obtain the LLaMA code from Huggingface, which does not involve the various parallel methods provided by Megatron-LM. Megatron-LLaMA offers a standard implementation of LLaMA in Megatron-LM, allowing developers to configure the optimization techniques on demand. We will continue to release features such as Alibi and FlashAttention2 in the future.

(ii) Efficient communication-computation parallelism: Similar to DeepSpeed ZeRO Stage 2, Megatron-LM implements DistributedOptimizer that partitions the gradient and optimizer state, significantly reducing GPU memory usage. However, the solution provided by Megatron-LM does not fully overlap GPU computation with communication, resulting in underutilization of hardware resources. Building upon the original DistributedOptimizer and ZeRO-Stage-2, Megatron-LLaMA proposes a novel approach for gradient and optimizer state sharding, achieving the following benefits without compromising precision: a) extremely high parallelism between communication and computation; b) highly efficient utilization of communication bandwidth; c) lower GPU memory usage. Consequently, Megatron-LLaMA enables higher training throughput on the same hardware configuration than the vanilla Megatron-LM.

(iii) Utilities: Megatron-LLaMA supplements several utilities and improves the checkpoint mechanism in Megatron-LM, including: a) Distributed checkpoint saving/restoring to speedup. This also provides abstract filesystem interfaces for easily integrating distributed file systems such as HDFS; b) Convenient interface for weight conversion from/to the HuggingFace format, facilitating the delivery to the downstream tasks after pretraining; c) Support for Tokenizers in HuggingFace transformers library.

This is the implementation for the paper Fine-Tuning Language Models with Just Forward Passes. In this paper we propose a memory-efficient zeroth-order optimizer (MeZO), adapting the classical zeroth-order SGD method to operate in-place, thereby fine-tuning language models (LMs) with the same memory footprint as inference.

With a single A100 80GB GPU, MeZO can train a 30-billion parameter OPT model, whereas fine-tuning with Adam can train only a 2.7B LM. MeZO demonstrates comparable performance to fine-tuning with backpropagation across multiple tasks, with up to 12× memory reduction. MeZO is also compatible with both full-parameter and parameter-efficient tuning techniques such as LoRA and prefix tuning. We also show that MeZO can effectively optimize non-differentiable objectives (e.g., maximizing accuracy or F1).

- https://github.com/xijiu9/Train_Transformers_with_INT4

Quantizing the activation, weight, and gradient to 4-bit is promising to accelerate neural network training. However, existing 4-bit training methods require custom numerical formats which are not supported by contemporary hardware. In this work, we propose a training method for transformers with all matrix multiplications implemented with the INT4 arithmetic. Training with an ultra-low INT4 precision is challenging. To achieve this, we carefully analyze the specific structures of activation and gradients in transformers to propose dedicated quantizers for them. For forward propagation, we identify the challenge of outliers and propose a Hadamard quantizer to suppress the outliers. For backpropagation, we leverage the structural sparsity of gradients by proposing bit splitting and leverage score sampling techniques to quantize gradients accurately. Our algorithm achieves competitive accuracy on a wide range of tasks including natural language understanding, machine translation, and image classification. Unlike previous 4-bit training methods, our algorithm can be implemented on the current generation of GPUs. Our prototypical linear operator implementation is up to 2.2 times faster than the FP16 counterparts and speeds up the training by up to 35.1%.

### ChatDoctor

- https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14070

Recent large language models (LLMs) in the general domain, such as ChatGPT, have shown remarkable success in following instructions and producing human-like responses. However, such language models have yet to be adapted for the medical domain, resulting in poor accuracy of responses and an inability to provide sound advice on medical diagnoses, medications, etc. To address this problem, we fine-tuned our ChatDoctor model based on 100k real-world patient-physician conversations from an online medical consultation site. Besides, we add autonomous knowledge retrieval capabilities to our ChatDoctor, for example, Wikipedia or a disease database as a knowledge brain. By fine-tuning the LLMs using these 100k patient-physician conversations, our model showed significant improvements in understanding patients' needs and providing informed advice. The autonomous ChatDoctor model based on Wikipedia and Database Brain can access real-time and authoritative information and answer patient questions based on this information, significantly improving the accuracy of the model's responses, which shows extraordinary potential for the medical field with a low tolerance for error.

### Code Llama (Meta AI)

Code Llama is a family of large language models for code based on Llama 2 providing state-of-the-art performance among open models, infilling capabilities, support for large input contexts, and zero-shot instruction following ability for programming tasks. We provide multiple flavors to cover a wide range of applications: foundation models (Code Llama), Python specializations (Code Llama - Python), and instruction-following models (Code Llama - Instruct) with 7B, 13B and 34B parameters each. All models are trained on sequences of 16k tokens and show improvements on inputs with up to 100k tokens. 7B and 13B Code Llama and Code Llama - Instruct variants support infilling based on surrounding content. Code Llama was developed by fine-tuning Llama 2 using a higher sampling of code. As with Llama 2, we applied considerable safety mitigations to the fine-tuned versions of the model. For detailed information on model training, architecture and parameters, evaluations, responsible AI and safety refer to our research paper. Output generated by code generation features of the Llama Materials, including Code Llama, may be subject to third party licenses, including, without limitation, open source licenses.

We are unlocking the power of large language models and our latest version of Code Llama is now accessible to individuals, creators, researchers and businesses of all sizes so that they can experiment, innovate and scale their ideas responsibly. This release includes model weights and starting code for pretrained and fine-tuned Llama language models — ranging from 7B to 34B parameters.

We show that anyone can take a dated off-the-shelf open source large language model (LLM) and give it magical ChatGPT-like instruction following ability by training it in 30 minutes on one machine, using high-quality training data. Surprisingly, instruction-following does not seem to require the latest or largest models: our model is only 6 billion parameters, compared to 175 billion for GPT-3. We open source the code for our model (Dolly) and show how it can be re-created on Databricks. We believe models like Dolly will help democratize LLMs, transforming them from something very few companies can afford into a commodity every company can own and customize to improve their products.

Large language models (LLMs) have shown the potential of revolutionizing natural language processing tasks in diverse domains, sparking great interest in finance. Accessing high-quality financial data is the first challenge for financial LLMs (FinLLMs). While proprietary models like BloombergGPT have taken advantage of their unique data accumulation, such privileged access calls for an open-source alternative to democratize Internet-scale financial data.

In this paper, we present an open-source large language model, FinGPT, for the finance sector. Unlike proprietary models, FinGPT takes a data-centric approach, providing researchers and practitioners with accessible and transparent resources to develop their FinLLMs. We highlight the importance of an automatic data curation pipeline and the lightweight low-rank adaptation technique in building FinGPT. Furthermore, we showcase several potential applications as stepping stones for users, such as robo-advising, algorithmic trading, and low-code development. Through collaborative efforts within the open-source AI4Finance community, FinGPT aims to stimulate innovation, democratize FinLLMs, and unlock new opportunities in open finance.

### Giraffe

- https://github.com/abacusai/long-context

The choice of how to encode positional information for transformers has been one of the key components of LLM architectures.

An area that has been interesting to us and others in the community recently is whether LLMs can be extended to longer contexts.

We have conducted a range of experiments with different schemes for extending context length capabilities of Llama, which has been pretrained on 2048 context length with the RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding) encoding. Here we share some of the results as well as the training and evaluation scripts in the hope that it will be useful to the community. For our best performing models - linear scaling with IFT at scales 4 and 16 - we are also sharing the weights in case others wish to use them, or to conduct their own tests. We believe the scale 16 model should perform well on real world tasks up to 16k context lengths, and potentially even up to about 20-24k context lengths.

在本文介绍了一种微调的语言模型：Goat。不同于以往对算术计算的研究，该模型在 LLaMA上采用端到端监督指令微调范式，利用包含约100万个样本的综合生成数据集进行训练得到。它非常擅长算术任务。Goat 在初等算术（包括整数的加法、减法、乘法和除法）中实现了最先进的性能。实验结果表明，仅通过监督微调而不应用任何特殊技术，「Goat模型能够在Zero-shot设置中以近乎完美的精度为大数加法和减法生成答案」。这种出色的算术能力归因于 LLaMA 对数字的一致标记化，并表明这对于以前的 LLM 来说几乎是不可能实现的，例如 Bloom、OPT、GPT-NeoX 、Pythia等。

 然而，该模型在面对乘除运算时遇到了很大的挑战。为了克服这一挑战，本文提出了一种方法，即「将各种算术任务分为可学习和不可学习任务」，随后利用基本算术原理将不可学习任务（例如多位数乘法和除法）分解为一系列可学习任务。本文方法确保促进模型学习的中间监督也很容易被人类理解，即通过模型微调在生成最终答案之前生成合适的CoT。「本文方法大大优于 GPT-4 的长乘法和长除法」。最终使用 BIG-bench (Srivastava et al., 2022) 算术子任务评估模型的性能，并对本文方法的有效性进行综合评估。实验结果表明，该模型可以学习计算模式并将其泛化到看不见的数据，而不仅仅是纯粹权重记忆计算。此外，Goat-7B 可以在24GB VRAM GPU上使用LoRA低秩适应技术进行训练，可以「很容易复现论文成果」。

Recent research has focused on enhancing the capability of smaller models through imitation learning, drawing on the outputs generated by large foundation models (LFMs). A number of issues impact the quality of these models, ranging from limited imitation signals from shallow LFM outputs; small scale homogeneous training data; and most notably a lack of rigorous evaluation resulting in overestimating the small model's capability as they tend to learn to imitate the style, but not the reasoning process of LFMs. To address these challenges, we develop Orca (We are working with our legal team to publicly release a diff of the model weights in accordance with LLaMA's release policy to be published at this https URL), a 13-billion parameter model that learns to imitate the reasoning process of LFMs. Orca learns from rich signals from GPT-4 including explanation traces; step-by-step thought processes; and other complex instructions, guided by teacher assistance from ChatGPT. To promote this progressive learning, we tap into large-scale and diverse imitation data with judicious sampling and selection. Orca surpasses conventional state-of-the-art instruction-tuned models such as Vicuna-13B by more than 100% in complex zero-shot reasoning benchmarks like Big-Bench Hard (BBH) and 42% on AGIEval. Moreover, Orca reaches parity with ChatGPT on the BBH benchmark and shows competitive performance (4 pts gap with optimized system message) in professional and academic examinations like the SAT, LSAT, GRE, and GMAT, both in zero-shot settings without CoT; while trailing behind GPT-4. Our research indicates that learning from step-by-step explanations, whether these are generated by humans or more advanced AI models, is a promising direction to improve model capabilities and skills.

This is the repository for RRHF (Rank Response to align Human Feedback) and open-sourced language models Wombat. RRHF helps align large language models with human perference easier.

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) enables the alignment of large language models with human preference, improving the quality of interactions between humans and language models. Recent practice of RLHF uses PPO to enable the large language model optimization of such alignment. However, implementing PPO is non-trivial (where the training procedure requires interactive between policy, behavior policy, reward, value model) and it is also tedious to tuning many hyper-parameters. Our motivation is to simplify the alignment between language models with human preference, and our proposed paradigm RRHF (Rank Response from Human Feedback) can achieve such alignment as easily as conventional fine-tuning. It is simpler than PPO from the aspects of coding, model counts, and hyperparameters.

### LLaMA 2 Long
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.16039.pdf

We present a series of long-context LLMs that support effective context windows of up to 32,768 tokens. Our model series are built through continual pretraining from Llama 2 with longer training sequences and on a dataset where long texts are upsampled. We perform extensive evaluation on language modeling, synthetic context probing tasks, and a wide range of research benchmarks. On research benchmarks, our models achieve consistent improvements on most regular tasks and significant improvements on long-context tasks over Llama 2. Notably, with a cost-effective instruction tuning procedure that does not require human-annotated long instruction data, the 70B variant can already surpass gpt-3.5-turbo-16k's overall performance on a suite of long-context tasks. Alongside these results, we provide an in-depth analysis on the individual components of our method. We delve into Llama's position encodings and discuss its limitation in modeling long dependencies. We also examine the impact of various design choices in the pretraining process, including the data mix and the training curriculum of sequence lengths -- our ablation experiments suggest that having abundant long texts in the pretrain dataset is not the key to achieving strong performance, and we empirically verify that long context continual pretraining is more efficient and similarly effective compared to pretraining from scratch with long sequences.

We collect about 64k prompts from diverse resources (including UltraChat, ShareGPT, Evol-Instruct, TruthfulQA, FalseQA, and FLAN, see here for dataset statistics). We then use these prompts to query multiple LLMs (see here for model lists) and generate 4 different responses for each prompt, resulting in a total of 256k samples.

To collect high-quality preference and textual feedback, we design a fine-grained annotation instruction, which contains 4 different aspects, namely instruction-following, truthfulness, honesty and helpfulness. We then ask GPT-4 to annotate the collected samples based on the instruction.

### Memory-GPT(MemGPT)

- https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08560

Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI, but are constrained by limited context windows, hindering their utility in tasks like extended conversations and document analysis. To enable using context beyond limited context windows, we propose virtual context management, a technique drawing inspiration from hierarchical memory systems in traditional operating systems that provide the appearance of large memory resources through data movement between fast and slow memory. Using this technique, we introduce MemGPT (Memory-GPT), a system that intelligently manages different memory tiers in order to effectively provide extended context within the LLM's limited context window, and utilizes interrupts to manage control flow between itself and the user. We evaluate our OS-inspired design in two domains where the limited context windows of modern LLMs severely handicaps their performance: document analysis, where MemGPT is able to analyze large documents that far exceed the underlying LLM's context window, and multi-session chat, where MemGPT can create conversational agents that remember, reflect, and evolve dynamically through long-term interactions with their users. 

### MetaMath
- https://github.com/meta-math/MetaMath

Large language models (LLMs) have pushed the limits of natural language understanding and exhibited excellent problem-solving ability. Despite the great success, most existing open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-2) are still far away from satisfactory for solving mathematical problem due to the complex reasoning procedures. To bridge this gap, we propose MetaMath, a fine-tuned language model that specializes in mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we start by bootstrapping mathematical questions by rewriting the question from multiple perspectives without extra knowledge, which results in a new dataset called MetaMathQA. Then we fine-tune the LLaMA-2 models on MetaMathQA. Experimental results on two popular benchmarks (i.e., GSM8K and MATH) for mathematical reasoning demonstrate that MetaMath outperforms a suite of open-source LLMs by a significant margin. Our MetaMath-7B model achieves 66.4% on GSM8K and 19.4% on MATH, exceeding the state-of-the-art models of the same size by 11.5% and 8.7%. Particularly, MetaMath-70B achieves an accuracy of 82.3% on GSM8K, slightly better than GPT-3.5-Turbo. We release all the MetaMathQA dataset, the MetaMath models with different model sizes and the training code for public use.

### ChipNeMo (芯片设计)
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00176

ChipNeMo aims to explore the applications of large language models (LLMs) for industrial chip design. Instead of directly deploying off-the-shelf commercial or open-source LLMs, we instead adopt the following domain adaptation techniques: custom tokenizers, domain-adaptive continued pretraining, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with domain-specific instructions, and domain-adapted retrieval models. We evaluate these methods on three selected LLM applications for chip design: an engineering assistant chatbot, EDA script generation, and bug summarization and analysis. Our results show that these domain adaptation techniques enable significant LLM performance improvements over general-purpose base models across the three evaluated applications, enabling up to 5x model size reduction with similar or better performance on a range of design tasks. Our findings also indicate that there's still room for improvement between our current results and ideal outcomes. We believe that further investigation of domain-adapted LLM approaches will help close this gap in the future.

### Zephyr
- https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook
- https://huggingface.co/collections/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-6538c6d6d5ddd1cbb1744a66

Just one year ago, chatbots were out of fashion and most people hadn't heard about techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to align language models with human preferences. Then, OpenAI broke the internet with ChatGPT and Meta followed suit by releasing the Llama series of language models which enabled the ML community to build their very own capable chatbots. This has led to a rich ecosystem of datasets and models that have mostly focused on teaching language models to follow instructions through supervised fine-tuning (SFT).

However, we know from the InstructGPT and Llama2 papers that significant gains in helpfulness and safety can be had by augmenting SFT with human (or AI) preferences. At the same time, aligning language models to a set of preferences is a fairly novel idea and there are few public resources available on how to train these models, what data to collect, and what metrics to measure for best downstream performance.

The Alignment Handbook aims to fill that gap by providing the community with a series of robust training recipes that span the whole pipeline.

- https://github.com/castorini/rank_llm

In information retrieval, proprietary large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and open-source counterparts such as LLaMA and Vicuna have played a vital role in reranking. However, the gap between open-source and closed models persists, with reliance on proprietary, non-transparent models constraining reproducibility. Addressing this gap, we introduce RankZephyr, a state-of-the-art, open-source LLM for listwise zero-shot reranking. RankZephyr not only bridges the effectiveness gap with GPT-4 but in some cases surpasses the proprietary model. Our comprehensive evaluations across several datasets (TREC Deep Learning Tracks; NEWS and COVID from BEIR) showcase this ability. RankZephyr benefits from strategic training choices and is resilient against variations in initial document ordering and the number of documents reranked. Additionally, our model outperforms GPT-4 on the NovelEval test set, comprising queries and passages past its training period, which addresses concerns about data contamination.

### LLM360（Amber,CrystalCoder,Diamond）
- https://www.llm360.ai/
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.06550.pdf

The recent surge in open-source Large Language Models (LLMs), such as LLaMA, Falcon, and Mistral, provides diverse options for AI practitioners and researchers. However, most LLMs have only released partial artifacts, such as the final model weights or inference code, and technical reports increasingly limit their scope to high-level design choices and surface statistics. These choices hinder progress in the field by degrading transparency into the training of LLMs and forcing teams to rediscover many details in the training process. We present LLM360, an initiative to fully open-source LLMs, which advocates for all training code and data, model checkpoints, and intermediate results to be made available to the community. The goal of LLM360 is to support open and collaborative AI research by making the end-to-end LLM training process transparent and reproducible by everyone. As a first step of LLM360, we release two 7B parameter LLMs pre-trained from scratch, Amber and CrystalCoder, including their training code, data, intermediate checkpoints, and analyses (at this https URL). We are committed to continually pushing the boundaries of LLMs through this open-source effort. More large-scale and stronger models are underway and will be released in the future.

### Multiscale Positive-Unlabeled Detection of AI-Generated Texts

Recent releases of Large Language Models (LLMs), e.g. ChatGPT, are astonishing at generating human-like texts, but they may get misused for fake scholarly texts, fake news, fake tweets, et cetera. Previous works have proposed methods to detect these multiscale AI-generated texts, including simple ML classifiers, pretrained-model-based training-agnostic methods, and finetuned language classification models. However, mainstream detectors are formulated without considering the factor of corpus length: shorter corpuses are harder to detect compared with longer ones for shortage of informative features. In this paper, a Multiscale Positive-Unlabeled (MPU) training framework is proposed to address the challenge of multiscale text detection. Firstly, we acknowledge the human-resemblance property of short machine texts, and rephrase text classification as a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) problem by marking these short machine texts as "unlabeled" during training. In this PU context, we propose the length-sensitive Multiscale PU Loss, where we use a recurrent model in abstraction to estimate positive priors of scale-variant corpuses. Additionally, we introduce a Text Multiscaling module to enrich training corpuses. Experiments show that our MPU method augments detection performance on long AI-generated text, and significantly improves short-corpus detection of language model detectors. Language Models trained with MPU could outcompete existing detectors by large margins on multiscale AI-generated texts.

### ALCUNA: Large Language Models Meet New Knowledge
- https://github.com/arvid-pku/alcuna

With the rapid development of NLP, large-scale language models (LLMs) excel in various tasks across multiple domains now. However, existing benchmarks may not adequately measure these models' capabilities, especially when faced with new knowledge. In this paper, we address the lack of benchmarks to evaluate LLMs' ability to handle new knowledge, an important and challenging aspect in the rapidly evolving world. We propose an approach called KnowGen that generates new knowledge by altering existing entity attributes and relationships, resulting in artificial entities that are distinct from real-world entities. With KnowGen, we introduce a benchmark named ALCUNA to assess LLMs' abilities in knowledge understanding, differentiation, and association. We benchmark several LLMs, reveals that their performance in face of new knowledge is not satisfactory, particularly in reasoning between new and internal knowledge. We also explore the impact of entity similarity on the model's understanding of entity knowledge and the influence of contextual entities. We appeal to the need for caution when using LLMs in new scenarios or with new knowledge, and hope that our benchmarks can help drive the development of LLMs in face of new knowledge.

### GLoRE: Evaluating Logical Reasoning of Large Language Models  
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09107

Recently, large language models (LLMs), including notable models such as GPT-4 and burgeoning community models, have showcased significant general language understanding abilities. However, there has been a scarcity of attempts to assess the logical reasoning capacities of these LLMs, an essential facet of natural language understanding. To encourage further investigation in this area, we introduce GLoRE, a meticulously assembled General Logical Reasoning Evaluation benchmark comprised of 12 datasets that span three different types of tasks. Our experimental results show that compared to the performance of human and supervised fine-tuning, the logical reasoning capabilities of open LLM models necessitate additional improvement; ChatGPT and GPT-4 show a strong capability of logical reasoning, with GPT-4 surpassing ChatGPT by a large margin. We propose a self-consistency probing method to enhance the accuracy of ChatGPT and a fine-tuned method to boost the performance of an open LLM. We release the datasets and evaluation programs to facilitate future research.

近一年，大模型发展迅速，带动了⼀系列通用人工智能技术的迅速发展，对大模型性能的评测随之涌现。

从评测能力上来看，由于目前的评测数据集主要是利用人类试题及其标准答案进行评测，这种评价方式更偏向对推理能力的评估，存在评估结果和模型真实能力有⼀定偏差。例如，英文数据集中，HELM1使用16个NLP数据集，MMLU2用57项人类考试科目来评测大模型。中文数据集中，GAOKAO3、C-Eval4等也采用人类试题，他们在自动化评测流程中都只包含有标准答案的问题，无法全面衡量生成式大模型的综合能力。

此外，目前也有一些工作关注到了模型的开放式问答，由斯坦福大学提出的的AlpacaEval5被广泛认可，但仅由英文问题组成，决定了只能评估模型在英文上的表现。包含中文开放式问答的SuperCLUE6数据集是首个提出开放式问答的中文数据集，但其数据集闭源，且也仅由中文问题组成。可以看到，目前已有的开放式问题数据集都是在单一语言上进行评测的，用来衡量模型的多语言能力的开源的开放式问答数据集仍然空缺。

综上所述，构建一个多语言的开放式问答数据集用以全面评测大模型的综合能力是有必要的。我们将从中文入手，逐渐迁移至其他语言。

The expanding application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in scientific fields presents unprecedented opportunities for discovery and innovation. However, this growth is not without risks. AI models in science, if misused, can amplify risks like creation of harmful substances, or circumvention of established regulations. In this study, we aim to raise awareness of the dangers of AI misuse in science, and call for responsible AI development and use in this domain. We first itemize the risks posed by AI in scientific contexts, then demonstrate the risks by highlighting real-world examples of misuse in chemical science. These instances underscore the need for effective risk management strategies. In response, we propose a system called SciGuard to control misuse risks for AI models in science. We also propose a red-teaming benchmark SciMT-Safety to assess the safety of different systems. Our proposed SciGuard shows the least harmful impact in the assessment without compromising performance in benign tests. Finally, we highlight the need for a multidisciplinary and collaborative effort to ensure the safe and ethical use of AI models in science. We hope that our study can spark productive discussions on using AI ethically in science among researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and the public, to maximize benefits and minimize the risks of misuse.

### HaluEval 2.0, The Dawn After the Dark: An Empirical Study on Factuality Hallucination in Large Language Models
- https://github.com/RUCAIBox/HaluEval-2.0
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03205

In the era of large language models (LLMs), hallucination (i.e., the tendency to generate factually incorrect content) poses great challenge to trustworthy and reliable deployment of LLMs in real-world applications. To tackle the LLM hallucination, three key questions should be well studied: how to detect hallucinations (detection), why do LLMs hallucinate (source), and what can be done to mitigate them (mitigation). To address these challenges, this work presents a systematic empirical study on LLM hallucination, focused on the the three aspects of hallucination detection, source and mitigation. Specially, we construct a new hallucination benchmark HaluEval 2.0, and designs a simple yet effective detection method for LLM hallucination. Furthermore, we zoom into the different training or utilization stages of LLMs and extensively analyze the potential factors that lead to the LLM hallucination. Finally, we implement and examine a series of widely used techniques to mitigate the hallucinations in LLMs. Our work has led to several important findings to understand the hallucination origin and mitigate the hallucinations in LLMs. 

### DebugBench: Evaluating Debugging Capability of Large Language Models
- https://github.com/thunlp/DebugBench
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04621

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional coding capability. However, as another critical component of programming proficiency, the debugging capability of LLMs remains relatively unexplored. Previous evaluations of LLMs' debugging ability are significantly limited by the risk of data leakage, the scale of the dataset, and the variety of tested bugs. To overcome these deficiencies, we introduce `DebugBench', an LLM debugging benchmark consisting of 4,253 instances. It covers four major bug categories and 18 minor types in C++, Java, and Python. To construct DebugBench, we collect code snippets from the LeetCode community, implant bugs into source data with GPT-4, and assure rigorous quality checks. We evaluate two commercial and three open-source models in a zero-shot scenario. We find that (1) while closed-source models like GPT-4 exhibit inferior debugging performance compared to humans, open-source models such as Code Llama fail to attain any pass rate scores; (2) the complexity of debugging notably fluctuates depending on the bug category; (3) incorporating runtime feedback has a clear impact on debugging performance which is not always helpful. As an extension, we also compare LLM debugging and code generation, revealing a strong correlation between them for closed-source models. These findings will benefit the development of LLMs in debugging.

### R-Judge

- https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10019

Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited great potential in autonomously completing tasks across real-world applications. Despite this, these LLM agents introduce unexpected safety risks when operating in interactive environments. Instead of centering on LLM-generated content safety in most prior studies, this work addresses the imperative need for benchmarking the behavioral safety of LLM agents within diverse environments. We introduce R-Judge, a benchmark crafted to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in judging safety risks given agent interaction records. R-Judge comprises 162 agent interaction records, encompassing 27 key risk scenarios among 7 application categories and 10 risk types. It incorporates human consensus on safety with annotated safety risk labels and high-quality risk descriptions. Utilizing R-Judge, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 8 prominent LLMs commonly employed as the backbone for agents. The best-performing model, GPT-4, achieves 72.29% in contrast to the human score of 89.38%, showing considerable room for enhancing the risk awareness of LLMs. Notably, leveraging risk descriptions as environment feedback significantly improves model performance, revealing the importance of salient safety risk feedback. Furthermore, we design an effective chain of safety analysis technique to help the judgment of safety risks and conduct an in-depth case study to facilitate future research.

### TravelPlanner
- https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/TravelPlanner/

We introduce TravelPlanner: a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the planning abilities of language agents in real-world scenarios across multiple dimensions. Without losing generality, TravelPlanner casts travel planning as its test environment, with all relevant information meticulously crafted to minimize data contamination. TravelPlanner does not have a singular ground truth for each query. Instead, the benchmark employs several pre-defined evaluation scripts to assess each tested plan, determining whether the language agent can effectively use tools to create a plan that aligns with both the implicit commonsense and explicit user needs outlined in the query (i.e., commonsense constraint and hard constraint). Every query in TravelPlanner has undergone thorough human verification to guarantee that feasible solutions exist. Additionally, TravelPlanner evaluates the language agent's capability by varying the breadth and depth of planning, controlled through the number of travel days and the quantity of hard constraints.

### Matryoshka Representation Learning
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13147
- https://github.com/RAIVNLab/MRL

Learned representations are a central component in modern ML systems, serving a multitude of downstream tasks. When training such representations, it is often the case that computational and statistical constraints for each downstream task are unknown. In this context rigid, fixed capacity representations can be either over or under-accommodating to the task at hand. This leads us to ask: can we design a flexible representation that can adapt to multiple downstream tasks with varying computational resources? Our main contribution is Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) which encodes information at different granularities and allows a single embedding to adapt to the computational constraints of downstream tasks. MRL minimally modifies existing representation learning pipelines and imposes no additional cost during inference and deployment. MRL learns coarse-to-fine representations that are at least as accurate and rich as independently trained low-dimensional representations. The flexibility within the learned Matryoshka Representations offer: (a) up to 14x smaller embedding size for ImageNet-1K classification at the same level of accuracy; (b) up to 14x real-world speed-ups for large-scale retrieval on ImageNet-1K and 4K; and (c) up to 2% accuracy improvements for long-tail few-shot classification, all while being as robust as the original representations. Finally, we show that MRL extends seamlessly to web-scale datasets (ImageNet, JFT) across various modalities -- vision (ViT, ResNet), vision + language (ALIGN) and language (BERT).

### GRIT
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09906
- https://github.com/ContextualAI/gritlm

All text-based language problems can be reduced to either generation or embedding. Current models only perform well at one or the other. We introduce generative representational instruction tuning (GRIT) whereby a large language model is trained to handle both generative and embedding tasks by distinguishing between them through instructions. Compared to other open models, our resulting GritLM 7B sets a new state of the art on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) and outperforms all models up to its size on a range of generative tasks. By scaling up further, GritLM 8x7B outperforms all open generative language models that we tried while still being among the best embedding models. Notably, we find that GRIT matches training on only generative or embedding data, thus we can unify both at no performance loss. Among other benefits, the unification via GRIT speeds up Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by > 60% for long documents, by no longer requiring separate retrieval and generation models.

在许多下游任务中，我们往往只需要使用到一两种语言，例如在中文场景中，一般只会用到中英文。 所以我们可以对大语言模型的词表进行裁剪，只留下所需的部分词表，这样不仅能够充分保留模型的预训练知识，并且减少模型参数量，降低显存占用，提升训练速度，使用更少的显卡进行下游任务的finetune训练。

基于上述原因，笔者开发了LLMPruner项目，目前主要包含裁剪后的各种参数规模的Bloom模型。对Bloom进行词表裁剪，保留常用的中英文token，词表由250880将至46145，缩减为原来的18.39%。

### LLM for Recommendation Systems

- https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19860
- https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/WCUjCahiak4STbb0QjJInQ

Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and have recently gained significant attention in the domain of Recommendation Systems (RS). These models, trained on massive amounts of data using self-supervised learning, have demonstrated remarkable success in learning universal representations and have the potential to enhance various aspects of recommendation systems by some effective transfer techniques such as fine-tuning and prompt tuning, and so on. The crucial aspect of harnessing the power of language models in enhancing recommendation quality is the utilization of their high-quality representations of textual features and their extensive coverage of external knowledge to establish correlations between items and users. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the existing LLM-based recommendation systems, this survey presents a taxonomy that categorizes these models into two major paradigms, respectively Discriminative LLM for Recommendation (DLLM4Rec) and Generative LLM for Recommendation (GLLM4Rec), with the latter being systematically sorted out for the first time. Furthermore, we systematically review and analyze existing LLM-based recommendation systems within each paradigm, providing insights into their methodologies, techniques, and performance. Additionally, we identify key challenges and several valuable findings to provide researchers and practitioners with inspiration.

A Simple and Effective Pruning Approach for Large Language Models

### Streaming LLM
- https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-llm

Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach --- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a ``sink'' even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence length without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.

Sheared-LLaMA models are first pruned from the LLaMA2-7B model, and then trained on only 50B tokens, 5% budget of the previous strongest public 3B model.

### QA-LoRA
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14717
- https://github.com/yuhuixu1993/qa-lora

Recently years have witnessed a rapid development of large language models (LLMs). Despite the strong ability in many language-understanding tasks, the heavy computational burden largely restricts the application of LLMs especially when one needs to deploy them onto edge devices. In this paper, we propose a quantization-aware low-rank adaptation (QA-LoRA) algorithm. The motivation lies in the imbalanced degrees of freedom of quantization and adaptation, and the solution is to use group-wise operators which increase the degree of freedom of quantization meanwhile decreasing that of adaptation. QA-LoRA is easily implemented with a few lines of code, and it equips the original LoRA with two-fold abilities: (i) during fine-tuning, the LLM's weights are quantized (e.g., into INT4) to reduce time and memory usage; (ii) after fine-tuning, the LLM and auxiliary weights are naturally integrated into a quantized model without loss of accuracy. We apply QA-LoRA to the LLaMA and LLaMA2 model families and validate its effectiveness in different fine-tuning datasets and downstream scenarios.

### Transformer Index for GEnerative Recommenders (TIGER)
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.05065.pdf

Modern recommender systems perform large-scale retrieval by first embedding queries and item candidates in the same unified space, followed by approximate nearest neighbor search to select top candidates given a query embedding. In this paper, we propose a novel generative retrieval approach, where the retrieval model autoregressively decodes the identifiers of the target candidates. To that end, we create semantically meaningful tuple of codewords to serve as a Semantic ID for each item. Given Semantic IDs for items in a user session, a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model is trained to predict the Semantic ID of the next item that the user will interact with. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Semantic ID-based generative model for recommendation tasks. We show that recommender systems trained with the proposed paradigm significantly outperform the current SOTA models on various datasets. In addition, we show that incorporating Semantic IDs into the sequence-to-sequence model enhances its ability to generalize, as evidenced by the improved retrieval performance observed for items with no prior interaction history.

KnowPAT incorporates domain knowledge graphs to construct preference set and design new alignment objective to fine-tune the LLMs.

### AuthentiGPT: Detecting Machine-Generated Text
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07700

Large language models (LLMs) have opened up enormous opportunities while simultaneously posing ethical dilemmas. One of the major concerns is their ability to create text that closely mimics human writing, which can lead to potential misuse, such as academic misconduct, disinformation, and fraud. To address this problem, we present AuthentiGPT, an efficient classifier that distinguishes between machine-generated and human-written texts. Under the assumption that human-written text resides outside the distribution of machine-generated text, AuthentiGPT leverages a black-box LLM to denoise input text with artificially added noise, and then semantically compares the denoised text with the original to determine if the content is machine-generated. With only one trainable parameter, AuthentiGPT eliminates the need for a large training dataset, watermarking the LLM's output, or computing the log-likelihood. Importantly, the detection capability of AuthentiGPT can be easily adapted to any generative language model. With a 0.918 AUROC score on a domain-specific dataset, AuthentiGPT demonstrates its effectiveness over other commercial algorithms, highlighting its potential for detecting machine-generated text in academic settings.

### Curiosity-driven Red-teaming for Large Language Models
- https://openreview.net/forum?id=4KqkizXgXU

Large language models (LLMs) hold great potential for various natural language applications but risk generating incorrect or toxic content. In order to probe when an LLM generates unwanted content, the current paradigm is to recruit human testers to create input prompts (i.e., test cases) designed to elicit unfavorable responses from LLMs. This procedure is called red teaming. However, relying solely on human testers can be both expensive and time-consuming. Recent works automate red teaming by training LLMs (i.e., red team LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) to maximize the chance of eliciting undesirable responses (i.e., successful test cases) from the target LLMs being evaluated. However, while effective at provoking undesired responses, current RL methods lack test case diversity as RL-based methods tend to consistently generate the same few successful test cases once found. To overcome this limitation, we introduce curiosity-driven exploration to train red team models. This approach jointly maximizes the test case effectiveness and novelty. Maximizing novelty motivates the red-team model to search for new and diverse test cases. We evaluate our method by performing red teaming against LLMs in text continuation and instruction following tasks. Our experiments show that curiosity-driven exploration achieves greater diversity in all the experiments compared to existing RL-based red team methods while maintaining effectiveness. Remarkably, curiosity-driven exploration also enhances the effectiveness when performing red teaming in instruction following test cases, generating a higher number of successful test cases. We even demonstrate that curiosity-driven exploration successfully provokes toxic responses from the LLaMA2 model that has undergone finetuning based on human preferences.

### Language Models are Super Mario（DARE, Drop And REscale）

- https://github.com/yule-BUAA/MergeLM

In this work, we uncover that Language Models (LMs), either encoder- or decoder-based, can obtain new capabilities by assimilating the parameters of homologous models without the need for retraining or GPUs.

- We introduce a novel operation called DARE to directly set most of (90% or even 99%) the delta parameters to zeros without affecting the capabilities of SFT LMs.
- We sparsify delta parameters of multiple SFT homologous models with DARE as a general preprocessing technique and subsequently merge them into a single model by parameter averaging.

### TinyGSM
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09241

Small-scale models offer various computational advantages, and yet to which extent size is critical for problem-solving abilities remains an open question. Specifically for solving grade school math, the smallest model size so far required to break the 80% barrier on the GSM8K benchmark remains to be 34B. Our work studies how high-quality datasets may be the key for small language models to acquire mathematical reasoning. We introduce TinyGSM, a synthetic dataset of 12.3M grade school math problems paired with Python solutions, generated fully by GPT-3.5. After finetuning on TinyGSM, we find that a duo of a 1.3B generation model and a 1.3B verifier model can achieve 81.5% accuracy, outperforming existing models that are orders of magnitude larger. This also rivals the performance of the GPT-3.5 teacher model (77.4%), from which our model's training data is generated. Our approach is simple and has two key components: 1) the high-quality dataset TinyGSM, 2) the use of a verifier, which selects the final outputs from multiple candidate generations.

### Blending Is All You Need: Cheaper, Better Alternative to Trillion-Parameters LLM
- https://huggingface.co/ChaiML

In conversational AI research, there's a noticeable trend towards developing models with a larger number of parameters, exemplified by models like ChatGPT. While these expansive models tend to generate increasingly better chat responses, they demand significant computational resources and memory. This study explores a pertinent question: Can a combination of smaller models collaboratively achieve comparable or enhanced performance relative to a singular large model? We introduce an approach termed "blending", a straightforward yet effective method of integrating multiple chat AIs. Our empirical evidence suggests that when specific smaller models are synergistically blended, they can potentially outperform or match the capabilities of much larger counterparts. For instance, integrating just three models of moderate size (6B/13B paramaeters) can rival or even surpass the performance metrics of a substantially larger model like ChatGPT (175B+ paramaters). This hypothesis is rigorously tested using A/B testing methodologies with a large user base on the Chai research platform over a span of thirty days. The findings underscore the potential of the "blending" strategy as a viable approach for enhancing chat AI efficacy without a corresponding surge in computational demands.

### AUTOACT
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05268
- https://github.com/zjunlp/AutoAct

Language agents have achieved considerable performance on various complex tasks. Despite the incessant exploration in this field, existing language agent systems still struggle with costly, non-reproducible data reliance and face the challenge of compelling a single model for multiple functions. To this end, we introduce AutoAct, an automatic agent learning framework that does not rely on large-scale annotated data and synthetic trajectories from closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4). Given limited data with a tool library, AutoAct first automatically synthesizes planning trajectories without any assistance from humans or strong closed-source models. Then, AutoAct leverages a division-of-labor strategy to automatically differentiate based on the target task information and synthesized trajectories, producing a sub-agent group to complete the task. We conduct comprehensive experiments with different LLMs, which demonstrates that AutoAct yields better or parallel performance compared to various strong baselines. We even notice that AutoAct, when using the Llama-2-13b model, can achieve performance comparable to that of the zero-shot GPT-3.5-Turbo agent.

### MetaGPT

- https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT

Remarkable progress has been made on automated problem solving through societies of agents based on large language models (LLMs). Existing LLM-based multi-agent systems can already solve simple dialogue tasks. Solutions to more complex tasks, however, are complicated through logic inconsistencies due to cascading hallucinations caused by naively chaining LLMs. Here we introduce MetaGPT, an innovative meta-programming framework incorporating efficient human workflows into LLM-based multi-agent collaborations. MetaGPT encodes Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) into prompt sequences for more streamlined workflows, thus allowing agents with human-like domain expertise to verify intermediate results and reduce errors. MetaGPT utilizes an assembly line paradigm to assign diverse roles to various agents, efficiently breaking down complex tasks into subtasks involving many agents working together. On collaborative software engineering benchmarks, MetaGPT generates more coherent solutions than previous chat-based multi-agent systems. 

### Multi-LLM-Agent
- https://github.com/X-PLUG/Multi-LLM-Agent
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07324

Large Language Model (LLM) agents significantly extend the capabilities of standalone LLMs, empowering them to interact with external tools (e.g., APIs, functions) and complete complex tasks in a self-directed fashion. The challenge of tool use demands that LLMs not only understand user queries and generate answers but also excel in task planning, memory management, tool invocation, and result summarization. While traditional approaches focus on training a single LLM with all these capabilities, performance limitations become apparent, particularly with smaller models. Moreover, the entire LLM may require retraining when tools are updated. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel strategy that decomposes the aforementioned capabilities into a planner, caller, and summarizer. Each component is implemented by a single LLM that focuses on a specific capability and collaborates with other components to accomplish the task. This modular framework facilitates individual updates and the potential use of smaller LLMs for building each capability. To effectively train this framework, we introduce a two-stage training paradigm. First, we fine-tune a backbone LLM on the entire dataset without discriminating sub-tasks, providing the model with a comprehensive understanding of the task. Second, the fine-tuned LLM is used to instantiate the planner, caller, and summarizer respectively, which are continually fine-tuned on respective sub-tasks. Evaluation across various tool-use benchmarks illustrates that our proposed multi-LLM framework surpasses the traditional single-LLM approach, highlighting its efficacy and advantages in tool learning.

### More Agents Is All You Need
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05120
- https://anonymous.4open.science/r/more_agent_is_all_you_need

We find that, simply via a sampling-and-voting method, the performance of large language models (LLMs) scales with the number of agents instantiated. Also, this method is orthogonal to existing complicated methods to further enhance LLMs, while the degree of enhancement is correlated to the task difficulty. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a wide range of LLM benchmarks to verify the presence of our finding, and to study the properties that can facilitate its occurrence.

### Mistral-Interact
- https://github.com/HBX-hbx/Mistral-Interact
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09205

Current language model-driven agents often lack mechanisms for effective user participation, which is crucial given the vagueness commonly found in user instructions. Although adept at devising strategies and performing tasks, these agents struggle with seeking clarification and grasping precise user intentions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Intention-in-Interaction (IN3), a novel benchmark designed to inspect users' implicit intentions through explicit queries. Next, we propose the incorporation of model experts as the upstream in agent designs to enhance user-agent interaction. Employing IN3, we empirically train Mistral-Interact, a powerful model that proactively assesses task vagueness, inquires user intentions, and refines them into actionable goals before starting downstream agent task execution. Integrating it into the XAgent framework, we comprehensively evaluate the enhanced agent system regarding user instruction understanding and execution, revealing that our approach notably excels at identifying vague user tasks, recovering and summarizing critical missing information, setting precise and necessary agent execution goals, and minimizing redundant tool usage, thus boosting overall efficiency. All the data and codes are released.

### KnowAgent
- https://www.zjukg.org/project/KnowAgent/
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03101
- https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowAgent

Our development is grounded on several key steps: Initially, we create an extensive action knowledge base, which amalgamates action planning knowledge pertinent to specific tasks. This database acts as an external reservoir of information, steering the model's action generation process. Subsequently, by converting action knowledge into text, we enable the model to deeply understand and utilize this knowledge in creating action trajectories. Finally, through a knowledgeable self-learning phase, we use trajectories developed from the model's iterative processes to continually improve its understanding and application of action knowledge. This process not only strengthens the agents' planning abilities but also enhances their potential for application in complex situations.

### LlamaGym
- https://github.com/KhoomeiK/LlamaGym

"Agents" originated in reinforcement learning, where they learn by interacting with an environment and receiving a reward signal. However, LLM-based agents today do not learn online (i.e. continuously in real time) via reinforcement.

OpenAI created Gym to standardize and simplify RL environments, but if you try dropping an LLM-based agent into a Gym environment for training, you'd find it's still quite a bit of code to handle LLM conversation context, episode batches, reward assignment, PPO setup, and more.

LlamaGym seeks to simplify fine-tuning LLM agents with RL. Right now, it's a single Agent abstract class that handles all the issues mentioned above, letting you quickly iterate and experiment with agent prompting & hyperparameters across any Gym environment.

### WorkArena

We study the use of large language model-based agents for interacting with software via web browsers. Unlike prior work, we focus on measuring the agents' ability to perform tasks that span the typical daily work of knowledge workers utilizing enterprise software systems. To this end, we propose WorkArena, a remote-hosted benchmark of 29 tasks based on the widely-used ServiceNow platform. We also introduce BrowserGym, an environment for the design and evaluation of such agents, offering a rich set of actions as well as multimodal observations. Our empirical evaluation reveals that while current agents show promise on WorkArena, there remains a considerable gap towards achieving full task automation. Notably, our analysis uncovers a significant performance disparity between open and closed-source LLMs, highlighting a critical area for future exploration and development in the field.

### ConflictingQA
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11782
- https://github.com/AlexWan0/rag-convincingness

Retrieval-augmented language models are being increasingly tasked with subjective, contentious, and conflicting queries such as "is aspartame linked to cancer". To resolve these ambiguous queries, one must search through a large range of websites and consider "which, if any, of this evidence do I find convincing?". In this work, we study how LLMs answer this question. In particular, we construct ConflictingQA, a dataset that pairs controversial queries with a series of real-world evidence documents that contain different facts (e.g., quantitative results), argument styles (e.g., appeals to authority), and answers (Yes or No). We use this dataset to perform sensitivity and counterfactual analyses to explore which text features most affect LLM predictions. Overall, we find that current models rely heavily on the relevance of a website to the query, while largely ignoring stylistic features that humans find important such as whether a text contains scientific references or is written with a neutral tone. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of RAG corpus quality (e.g., the need to filter misinformation), and possibly even a shift in how LLMs are trained to better align with human judgements.

### Medical Information Retrieval-Augmented Generation Evaluation （MIRAGE）
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13178
- https://teddy-xionggz.github.io/benchmark-medical-rag/

While large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of medical question answering (QA) tasks, they still face challenges with hallucinations and outdated knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising solution and has been widely adopted. However, a RAG system can involve multiple flexible components, and there is a lack of best practices regarding the optimal RAG setting for various medical purposes. To systematically evaluate such systems, we propose the Medical Information Retrieval-Augmented Generation Evaluation (MIRAGE), a first-of-its-kind benchmark including 7,663 questions from five medical QA datasets. Using MIRAGE, we conducted large-scale experiments with over 1.8 trillion prompt tokens on 41 combinations of different corpora, retrievers, and backbone LLMs through the MedRAG toolkit introduced in this work. Overall, MedRAG improves the accuracy of six different LLMs by up to 18% over chain-of-thought prompting, elevating the performance of GPT-3.5 and Mixtral to GPT-4-level. Our results show that the combination of various medical corpora and retrievers achieves the best performance. In addition, we discovered a log-linear scaling property and the "lost-in-the-middle" effects in medical RAG. We believe our comprehensive evaluations can serve as practical guidelines for implementing RAG systems for medicine.

### ∞Bench
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13718
- https://github.com/OpenBMB/InfiniteBench

Processing and reasoning over long contexts is crucial for many practical applications of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as document comprehension and agent construction. Despite recent strides in making LLMs process contexts with more than 100K tokens, there is currently a lack of a standardized benchmark to evaluate this long-context capability. Existing public benchmarks typically focus on contexts around 10K tokens, limiting the assessment and comparison of LLMs in processing longer contexts. In this paper, we propose ∞Bench, the first LLM benchmark featuring an average data length surpassing 100K tokens. ∞Bench comprises synthetic and realistic tasks spanning diverse domains, presented in both English and Chinese. The tasks in ∞Bench are designed to require well understanding of long dependencies in contexts, and make simply retrieving a limited number of passages from contexts not sufficient for these tasks. In our experiments, based on ∞Bench, we evaluate the state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs tailored for processing long contexts. The results indicate that existing long context LLMs still require significant advancements to effectively process 100K+ context. We further present three intriguing analyses regarding the behavior of LLMs processing long context.

### Unlocking Efficiency in Large Language Model Inference: A Comprehensive Survey of Speculative Decoding
- https://github.com/hemingkx/SpeculativeDecodingPapers
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07851

To mitigate the high inference latency stemming from autoregressive decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs), Speculative Decoding has emerged as a novel decoding paradigm for LLM inference. In each decoding step, this method first efficiently drafts several future tokens and then verifies them in parallel. Unlike autoregressive decoding, Speculative Decoding facilitates the simultaneous decoding of multiple tokens per step, thereby accelerating inference. This paper presents a comprehensive overview and analysis of this promising decoding paradigm. We begin by providing a formal definition and formulation of Speculative Decoding. Then, we organize in-depth discussions on its key facets, including current leading techniques, the challenges faced, and potential future directions in this field. We aim for this work to serve as a catalyst for further research on Speculative Decoding, ultimately contributing to more efficient LLM inference.

### Meta-Prompting
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12954
- https://github.com/suzgunmirac/meta-prompting

We introduce meta-prompting, an effective scaffolding technique designed to enhance the functionality of language models (LMs). This approach transforms a single LM into a multi-faceted conductor, adept at managing and integrating multiple independent LM queries. By employing high-level instructions, meta-prompting guides the LM to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable subtasks. These subtasks are then handled by distinct "expert" instances of the same LM, each operating under specific, tailored instructions. Central to this process is the LM itself, in its role as the conductor, which ensures seamless communication and effective integration of the outputs from these expert models. It additionally employs its inherent critical thinking and robust verification processes to refine and authenticate the end result. This collaborative prompting approach empowers a single LM to simultaneously act as a comprehensive orchestrator and a panel of diverse experts, significantly enhancing its performance across a wide array of tasks. The zero-shot, task-agnostic nature of meta-prompting greatly simplifies user interaction by obviating the need for detailed, task-specific instructions. Furthermore, our research demonstrates the seamless integration of external tools, such as a Python interpreter, into the meta-prompting framework, thereby broadening its applicability and utility. Through rigorous experimentation with GPT-4, we establish the superiority of meta-prompting over conventional scaffolding methods: When averaged across all tasks, including the Game of 24, Checkmate-in-One, and Python Programming Puzzles, meta-prompting, augmented with a Python interpreter functionality, surpasses standard prompting by 17.1%, expert (dynamic) prompting by 17.3%, and multipersona prompting by 15.2%.

### RLMRec
- https://github.com/HKUDS/RLMRec
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15950

Recommender systems have seen significant advancements with the influence of deep learning and graph neural networks, particularly in capturing complex user-item relationships. However, these graph-based recommenders heavily depend on ID-based data, potentially disregarding valuable textual information associated with users and items, resulting in less informative learned representations. Moreover, the utilization of implicit feedback data introduces potential noise and bias, posing challenges for the effectiveness of user preference learning. While the integration of large language models (LLMs) into traditional ID-based recommenders has gained attention, challenges such as scalability issues, limitations in text-only reliance, and prompt input constraints need to be addressed for effective implementation in practical recommender systems. To address these challenges, we propose a model-agnostic framework RLMRec that aims to enhance existing recommenders with LLM-empowered representation learning. It proposes a recommendation paradigm that integrates representation learning with LLMs to capture intricate semantic aspects of user behaviors and preferences. RLMRec incorporates auxiliary textual signals, develops a user/item profiling paradigm empowered by LLMs, and aligns the semantic space of LLMs with the representation space of collaborative relational signals through a cross-view alignment framework. This work further establish a theoretical foundation demonstrating that incorporating textual signals through mutual information maximization enhances the quality of representations. In our evaluation, we integrate RLMRec with state-of-the-art recommender models, while also analyzing its efficiency and robustness to noise data.

### RAG vs Fine-tuning
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08406.pdf

There are two common ways in which developers are incorporating proprietary and domain-specific data when building applications of Large Language Models (LLMs): Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Fine-Tuning. RAG augments the prompt with the external data, while fine-Tuning incorporates the additional knowledge into the model itself. However, the pros and cons of both approaches are not well understood. In this paper, we propose a pipeline for fine-tuning and RAG, and present the tradeoffs of both for multiple popular LLMs, including Llama2-13B, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Our pipeline consists of multiple stages, including extracting information from PDFs, generating questions and answers, using them for fine-tuning, and leveraging GPT-4 for evaluating the results. We propose metrics to assess the performance of different stages of the RAG and fine-Tuning pipeline. We conduct an in-depth study on an agricultural dataset. Agriculture as an industry has not seen much penetration of AI, and we study a potentially disruptive application - what if we could provide location-specific insights to a farmer? Our results show the effectiveness of our dataset generation pipeline in capturing geographic-specific knowledge, and the quantitative and qualitative benefits of RAG and fine-tuning. We see an accuracy increase of over 6 p.p. when fine-tuning the model and this is cumulative with RAG, which increases accuracy by 5 p.p. further. In one particular experiment, we also demonstrate that the fine-tuned model leverages information from across geographies to answer specific questions, increasing answer similarity from 47% to 72%. Overall, the results point to how systems built using LLMs can be adapted to respond and incorporate knowledge across a dimension that is critical for a specific industry, paving the way for further applications of LLMs in other industrial domains.

### Chain of Abstraction
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17464.pdf

To achieve faithful reasoning that aligns with human expectations, large language models (LLMs) need to ground their reasoning to real-world knowledge (e.g., web facts, math and physical rules). Tools help LLMs access this external knowledge, but there remains challenges for fine-tuning LLM agents (e.g., Toolformer) to invoke tools in multi-step reasoning problems, where inter-connected tool calls require holistic and efficient tool usage planning.
In this work, we propose a new method for LLMs to better leverage tools in multi-step reasoning. Our method, Chain-of-Abstraction (CoA), trains LLMs to first decode reasoning chains with abstract placeholders, and then call domain tools to reify each reasoning chain by filling in specific knowledge. This planning with abstract chains enables LLMs to learn more general reasoning strategies, which are robust to shifts of domain knowledge (e.g., math results) relevant to different reasoning questions. It also allows LLMs to perform decoding and calling of external tools in parallel, which avoids the inference delay caused by waiting for tool responses. In mathematical reasoning and Wiki QA domains, we show that our method consistently outperforms previous chain-of-thought and tool-augmented baselines on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets, with an average ~6% absolute QA accuracy improvement. LLM agents trained with our method also show more efficient tool use, with inference speed being on average ~1.4x faster than baseline tool-augmented LLMs.

### Transformer Debugger
- https://github.com/openai/transformer-debugger

Transformer Debugger (TDB) is a tool developed by OpenAI's Superalignment team with the goal of supporting investigations into specific behaviors of small language models. The tool combines automated interpretability techniques with sparse autoencoders.

TDB enables rapid exploration before needing to write code, with the ability to intervene in the forward pass and see how it affects a particular behavior. It can be used to answer questions like, "Why does the model output token A instead of token B for this prompt?" or "Why does attention head H attend to token T for this prompt?" It does so by identifying specific components (neurons, attention heads, autoencoder latents) that contribute to the behavior, showing automatically generated explanations of what causes those components to activate most strongly, and tracing connections between components to help discover circuits.
